# Active Listening

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Active listening is a key component of curiosity as social practice, particularly emphasized by [[LP1 (Louise)]].

## Louise's Emphasis

> "And remember the answer!!!"

This simple reminder captures something essential:
- Asking questions isn't enough
- You must **listen** to answers
- You must **remember** what you learned
- You must **follow up** over time

## Components of Active Listening

Beyond just hearing:
- **Attention** - being fully present
- **Understanding** - grasping what's said
- **Remembering** - retaining information
- **Following up** - referring back in future conversations
- **Caring** - treating the answer as valuable

## Connection to Etymology

From [[Etymology of Curiosity]]:

> "To be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

**Listening is how we pay attention** to what curiosity reveals.

## Without Active Listening

[[Gil Friend]]'s stories of one-way conversations:
- People asked Gil questions
- Gil answered
- But did they **listen**?
- Did they **remember**?
- Did they **care**?

Asking without listening is [[Genuine vs Performative Curiosity|performative curiosity]].

## Jerry's List

[[Jerry Michalski]]:

> "What happened to listening? To discourse? To critical thinking? To civility?"

Listening as foundational to:
- Discourse
- Understanding
- Connection
- Learning

## In Social Practice

[[Pete Kaminski]]'s social curiosity practice requires:
- Asking questions (the practice)
- **Listening to answers** (the essential part)
- Remembering and following up (the proof of care)

## Making It Real

How to practice active listening:
- Put away distractions
- Look at the person
- Don't plan your next statement while they talk
- Ask follow-up questions
- Remember for next conversation
- Show you remember
