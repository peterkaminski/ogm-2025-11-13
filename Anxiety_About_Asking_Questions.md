The tension and discomfort that can arise when trying to formulate questions.

## Gabriele's Experience

[[Gabriele G]]:

> "I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because 'I don't know what to ask (first)'"

Anxiety from:
- Freedom without structure
- Fear of asking "wrong" thing
- Vague thoughts not yet formed
- Performance pressure

## Sources
