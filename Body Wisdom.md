**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The intelligence of the body, distinct from mental reasoning.

[[Eve Blossom]]'s work with [[Somatic Experiencing]] recognizes:

> "When we tune into the subtle signals of the body..."

The body knows:
- When we're safe or unsafe
- What resonates or doesn't
- When curiosity is genuine or forced
- Spaciousness vs tension

## For Curiosity

Body wisdom might tell us:
- When to explore or withdraw
- What to be curious about
- When something is "off"
- Where genuine interest lies
