[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:17
Looks like it was created by people drawing on a board, which is very, very nice.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:19
And then…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:19
And just to make everyone comfortable, I have a copy of this State of the Board.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:25
So, if everything is messed…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:26
Excellent.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:28
It doesn't matter.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:29
Beautiful. So Victoria has taken a snapshot, and we're off to the races. So, riff on this, add to it.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:35
do whatever. Victoria, anything you want to add to what I just described?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:41
Well, my only…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:43
remark is what it's at the top left corner.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:48
Because…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:50
in that… in…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:52
in the mail, we were given many solutions.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:03:57
And closing very early the problem.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:01
And that's not what we should strive for. We should strive for open as many questions as possible. So if instead of saying,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:12
Uh, education, closest curiosity. We state it as a question.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:19
Does education close up?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:21
Then we will have more things to work with.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:27
Sounds great. I tend to think of it as just depositing of multiple theories instead of the choosing of one to close it down.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:33
Yes, well, the thing is…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:37
uh…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:38
Gathering all the opinions, but trying…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:04:42
to show that we are not closing, but opening.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:44
Yep. Perfect.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:46
Sounds great. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:49
Thank you, thank you. So, with that, I'll stop my screen share and hope that everybody can follow the links

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:55
And get, uh, into the Excalibra.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:01
And see if anybody wants to take an opening step, or… Victoria, if you want to take an opening step into the conversation, that would be great, too.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:10
But for me, as you have seen, it's, um…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:15
like, an ongoing theme?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:18
Like, when I first talked to you, Jerry, and you said that trust…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:21
And consumerism were your things?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:26
So, the other day, I understood that this also has been always a concern for me.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:34
And seeing how it exploded in the community,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:38
Mm-hmm.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:39
I thought, okay, instead of…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:42
Each of us, like…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:43
Taking it to one place or another?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:47
why don't we get everything inside, so we can maybe decide

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:52
We can work because

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:55
Here today, I have, uh…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:56
The issue of access?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:05:58
that links with…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:00
the fact that you say,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:04
Uh, books are, like, fossil knowledge.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:07
It's trapped. There are also the silos.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:11
the academia…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:13
that you need subscriptions, paid subscriptions, to…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:17
So, there are a lot of things going on, so maybe…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:22
We must, like, gather everything,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:25
And I start thinking how this relates to different OGM projects.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:30
Or maybe different things that can start from here.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:36
So the… my…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:06:41
I wanted to link this issue with the other issues that are going around in the community.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:47
Brilliant. Thank you, that's great.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:50
I love that. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:52
Kevin, please.

[Kevin Jones] 08:06:56
Is the premise that we are losing, or… curiosity is being diminished?

[Kevin Jones] 08:07:03
Uh, if that's it, I completely disagree, so I'm curious.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:08
I think… I think the question started as, hey, uh, kids in school seem incurious,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:15
things like that are happening. Like, are we losing curiosity? And I think in general,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:21
will agree with you that, no, no, no. And in particular, we have a selection bias problem here.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:26
Which is that I think everybody in this room is, like, really, really curious, and probably hangs out with really curious people.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:32
Um, but, uh, Victoria, I don't know if you want to address that, or anybody else.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:07:37
I'll say something on it. Oh, Scott, sorry, you were ahead of me.

[Scott Moehring] 08:07:42
I guess I hit my buzzer faster than you.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:07:44
Yeah.

[Scott Moehring] 08:07:47
Um, what… what struck me as interesting in this, I agree with you, Jerry, that we have a

[Scott Moehring] 08:07:54
a bias of the people in the room, because this room attracts those kinds of people. And my art…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:00
argument would be that this group tends to be high in openness.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:05
So if we look at the Big Five personality model, which is the…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:09
was statistically verified model of personality.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:12
Openness is one of the five dimensions.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:15
And that to mention…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:17
is… people who tend to be creative, interested in intellectual pursuits,

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:24
open to new things and new ways, curious.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:28
And it exists on a spectrum.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:30
There are people who are low in openness.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:33
And neither end of the spectrum…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:36
is…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:40
evolutionarily better, which is why we have…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:43
the spectrum. Sometimes you need to be less open.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:46
And you need to be more…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:49
literal, or more practical, or more…

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:54
um… tradition, or history, or ritual.

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:57
And sometimes you need to be more open,

[Scott Moehring] 08:08:59
And more accepting and more combining, and more…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:02
far-reaching, and that's roofing, which is why…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:05
my understanding of it is why we have both ends, but my thought is, is that…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:11
If we're looking for people who are… or if we're seeing things where evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:19
notice all of those instances where people are less curious, and I think those are the people who are…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:25
less on the open side, and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:27
that I, um, I tend to agree that it's not…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:31
I haven't seen a sea change in that, but that was one thing I wanted to put out there, is that I believe it exists on a…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:37
range, and that's the Big Five model kind of supports

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:09:41
Mm-hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:09:42
Thanks, Scott.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:09:44
Gill, please.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:09:46
Yeah, yeah, I've raised this a couple of times out of personal experience, um, which may have all kinds of selection bias in it. I've observed

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:09:55
The initial assessment that I formed with it was that people much younger than me were not curious, and how that showed up is conversations with them.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:06
Where I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:11
Which I found perplexing. And I found this even more striking in networking situations, where you're meeting somebody at a conference and you're chatting,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:20
And I've been really struck at how one-way those conversations have been.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:26
Um, and so I've taken recently to, um,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:30
doing something I've never done before, just like start to talk about things in the course of meeting someone new.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:36
I'll start to talk about what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I want to talk about, what I would have wanted to be asked about.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:42
And then the conversation proceeds kind of normally. They're interested, and there's back and forth, but the initiation, what I'm calling curiosity of asking questions about somebody else,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:51
what they're thinking, interested in, doing, or so forth.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:54
I'm noticing it in its absence.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:10:57
But to qualify what I just said,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:00
I was remembering last night, we… Jane and I had dinner

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:04
a few months ago, uh, with a person who we've known since she was, like, 12.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:09
Um, but she's now 55, or something like that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:13
And, um, she made us a lovely buffet. We had spent the afternoon in her backyard.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:20
spent about 3 hours together.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:24
Um, and she didn't ask a single question.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:27
Of us. How we do it, how's your life, how's your health? She knows that Jane has been going through major health issues for many years.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:35
to somebody who knows her and loves her.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:38
And… didn't ask anything.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:41
I was really… I was… I became increasingly uncomfortable. I was really baffled. I didn't figure out what was…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:46
What was weird until afterwards,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:48
But I've never been in a situation like that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:51
So, that… it echoes the question about curiosity. It challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people, because

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:11:58
She's, you know, not younger, she's younger than us, but she's not young.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:01
So, um, um, and one… let me throw one more data point into this, which is an old one. So, early on in natural logic, we were doing lots of site assessments of companies, looking, you know, looking at efficiency.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:15
Uh, and footprint reduction opportunities.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:18
And, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:21
Uh, one of my junior staff members, who's actually not so junior, like, you know, an engineer, smart,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:28
Um, analytical, had been with me on a number of these, and he finally went out on one of his own.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:35
And when he came back, I was really struck at how… at all kinds of information that he hadn't gathered.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:41
Um, and we kind of unpacked what he talked with the staff at the company about, and…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:47
I would say, like, did you ask him about ABC? He said, God, I didn't think of that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:52
So, this is maybe not curiosity, but it's a… the map of distinctions that leads somebody on a trail of investigation. It was very striking how different his

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:05
But I called Curiosity was. And how we had to kind of, you know, train him up.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:11
And being curious, investigating,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:15
Um, let me stop there, there's more to say, but I want to not hog the mic here.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:19
I'll stop there.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:20
Gil, I'm really appreciating your first-person stories. I really like that, you know, this person is doing this because I'm

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:26
I'm coming into this partly from having read a few too many stories about how incurious recent graduates seem to be when they come into work, which leads us into the education conversation. Is something happening to our kids who are busy

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:38
Cramming but not learning, uh,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:40
Have we stamped out, sort of, inquisitiveness in the schooling system? And that… and we'll go there.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:45
But I think there's lots of other things going on.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:13:49
that your stories are pointing to. Go ahead.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:51
And let me just say one other thing before I yield to Alex. I put a note in the chat. I'm an etymology geek, so I started quickly looking for etymology and found this thing saying, well, there's this curious etymology.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:00
Um, uh, curious etymology, curiosity relates to care.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:06
Kura. And so in this formulation, they're saying its origins reveal a deeper truth. To be curious as to care enough.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:13
To pay attention. So that may be a false trail, or that may be a relevant piece of this conversation, I don't know.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:14:20
That's lovely. I think that the etymology is important as well.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:14:24
Thanks.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:24
And Victoria, thank you, I stuck that into the drawing.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:14:27
Beautiful, yep. I saw that you did that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:28
Maybe not skillfully, but there it is.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:14:30
Excellent. Uh, Alex, please.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:14:42
I suddenly realized I didn't have it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:14:44
So, the points that have been made so far are very, sort of, not very… they're on the academic side of curiosity.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:14:54
my… I thought when we first mentioned it, we'd start talking about

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:00
the curiosity in the sense that we're so polarized that each side, or whoever it is,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:07
And I can go through the recordings, and I can find every single… sorry, not every single… at least one example where each one of you

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:14
has made a statement, and I'm thinking,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:17
But why don't you look at it from this point of view?

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:19
And it'll disprove your statement, okay? Every single one of you, I'm sure, I'll come up with.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:24
It's inherent in us. We want to feel good,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:28
So, so it depends on the topic. So if it's politics, and we're on the left or the right,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:32
We don't want to…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:35
challenge our mental model and belief system.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:39
So that's one of the obstacles to being curious.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:41
And it really puzzles me, because

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:44
And many people have said this in the Twittersphere or whatever,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:48
whatever it is, that it's really amazing that we as humans,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:53
We'll go to page one, and we'll read about some politician announcing a new this, that, and the other.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:59
And say how great the politician is, if we support them.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:02
And then we'll go to number 5, you know, page 5 of a newspaper.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:07
And there's an article of what Shy says the politicians are.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:10
And we can compartmentalize the two and not

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:14
cross-feed. If he's the shyester over there, if that part is lying over there.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:19
what tells you that they tell the truth here? And that, to me, it's curiosity, or…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:24
maybe I'm using the wrong word, which amazes me, because I do it, and I'm sure everybody else does it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:30
And yet, we know it. You know, it's sort of, um… The other thing was about the young. I had personal experience from my kids.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:38
I… what can I say?

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:40
I enjoy talking.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:42
discussing things with them.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:44
If there's no belief system involved, be it politics, religion, whatever it is.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:50
We have a great conversation.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:52
But as soon as we start discussing things we care about,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:56
And remember, the mechanic here is, so…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:59
That's an old what's-it, so he's not going to think about it the way as us.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:02
But what has amazes me is their reluctance

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:06
to even hear or question what their belief system… something that might challenge their belief system. It really is amazing, and I do think, Jerry, you mentioned it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:14
It's to do with, um, the way we've been taught, and it isn't something that's just happened. I think it's happened over time.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:21
that we kind of… maybe it's the influence of TV, because it's an acceptance machine, and on TV, you don't actually challenge anything, you just…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:29
watch and enjoy. You don't interact with it or something like that, maybe a radio as well.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:34
Maybe how the technology has grown, but…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:37
young people, I think it's a teaching system, or… they don't… they're not…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:42
the Fed information,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:44
And I always used to think… I always used to think I was challenged at school to think differently.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:50
But maybe I wasn't, I don't know. But that was the, um…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:55
That was the point I wanted to say, is that we are all doing this.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:59
every day, even in this call, we will do it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:02
that we're not… you guys call it curiosity, I call it…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:09
the not-standard, or what you see in front of you, point of view.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:14
That was me. Have you considered yourself all told off?

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:18
for not being perfect humans.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:19
Oh, totally.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:22
Totally, Alex, thank you. I'm thinking, at first, I am noticing that my image is flashing green every now and then. I think it's my little USB hub, which is…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:31
Not happy that I've got the microphone plugged in as well as the camera through it, so I'm gonna troubleshoot that, but in case you're like, what's going on with Jerry? It's not that I'm coming, phoning in from a different planet, it's that some of my…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:42
Systems are not cooperating properly.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:44
Um, Alex, I think a piece of what you were pointing to, I would have called critical thinking.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:18:50
And I'm also realizing that we could have replaced the word curiosity with the phrase critical thinking in the invite to today's call, and probably would have gotten a similar showing. And maybe that's a topic for future… it's adjacent, as Gil says, you know, right after

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:05
Right after my thing. Scott's unsure.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:08
But…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:11
there's a piece of what I think you're raising, Alex, which is about our identity and our self-image.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:17
And the preservation of self.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:19
or the… or even… or even…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:21
the development of self, and how… what we… who we think we are and where we think we stand,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:26
And I think there's an interesting bit of conversation here about

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:30
Are we now afraid to take a stand? Are we confused about where the stands are? Do we think that taking a stand has become…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:38
dangerous, uh, because of the level of… the poor level of discourse out there in the public arena.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:44
Are we afraid of being canceled, or afraid of being pounded, or trolled, or whatever else? And those all seem, you know, more or less legitimate.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:52
In the current environment.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:54
Let me go to Pete. And Alex, if you'll take your hand down from

[Jerry Michalski] 08:19:58
Before. Pete, please.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:01
Uh, thank you, Sherry. And, uh, Alex, thanks for telling us all off. I appreciate it.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:07
Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:09
Uh, I… I guess I wanted to say that I don't…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:13
I see declines in curiosity, but I think I also see increases in curiosity, too.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:20
So, I think it… it changes the landscape. It keeps changing. Um, I certainly know there are places where we kill curiosity.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:31
living in an entertainment culture where you're supposed to sit back and

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:36
consume, but not, uh, participate.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:38
is obviously a bad thing. Um, the way that we do education, uh,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:44
I, you know, as a kid growing up in school, there were lots of ways

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:49
Teachers killed Mike, uh, curiosity, um, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:54
and worse for other people in my classes.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:58
Um, I wanted to… the reason I raised my hand and wanted to say something was because of Gil's story about the person that he and Jane know.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:07
that didn't ask, uh, didn't ask

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:10
you know, about them. And it reminds me, I learned from Joanne, my wife, uh,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:18
to be able to have

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:21
to be able to be curious and have a conversation with somebody, even if…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:26
Maybe you don't care in the grander scheme of things, or you're shy, or whatever.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:32
I'm… I'm kind of shy.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:36
Um, and it's just a rote thing, right? Um, it's just human and polite, uh, to be sitting with somebody and to ask them, you know?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:45
you know, how's your life? Uh, do you have pets? Uh, do you have friends? Uh, you know, where did you grow up? Those kinds of things. It's not hard to do. And…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:57
I know I went from somebody who

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:59
didn't have that as a skill that I was ever taught, really, by my parents, or my peers, or my school.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:05
Um, uh, I learned that very quickly from Joanne.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:10
Um, and so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:12
one of, uh, certainly some curiosity is innate. I've got a lot of innate curiosity, and probably most of the people in this… in this room do.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:21
The place where I see that most nowadays is actually, um, working with AI, um,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:27
I've spent a lot of time showing people how, you know, this AI thing.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:32
And there are a lot of people who…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:36
Um, they play with it for a little bit, and it doesn't do anything interesting, and then they're done. And, you know, I'm like, well, I'm… I… when I tried playing with it, it was actually hard work, I remember.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:47
Having to sit down and go, okay, what can I do with it now? What crazy thing could I give it, you know?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:54
you know, I used to do things like write poetry in 3 different languages, come up with a short story that starts with blah, come up with, you know, all kinds of crazy stuff.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:05
Um, and it was not second nature to do that with this new…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:12
information tool. It was something I had to work through, but…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:16
I was so curious about it, I worked through it. And I see a lot of people bouncing off new technology, um, because of that.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:23
Same thing, you know, when people adopted the internet. Same thing when people adopted PCs.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:28
You know, I was an early adopter of those, and I was like, you know, I don't know what it does, but let me find out, let me try to break it, let me try to do crazy stuff with it, can it do this, can it do that?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:39
Um, so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:42
Some… some is definitely innate. Some curiosity is definitely innate, but another thing…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:48
that Gil's story made me realize, is some curiosity is a social practice.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:53
Um, you know, I…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:55
somewhere in our world, it ought to be

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:58
And end up that you get taught by your peers, or your school, or your parents, or somebody.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:04
You know, here's some things that you can do to…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:08
enact curiosity, even if you're not particularly interested,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:12
just enact it as a social practice because it helps everybody. You know, it helps, um, it helps people feel good when you talk about them. It helps people…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:21
It helps you learn stuff that you wouldn't have known otherwise when you're, you know, got

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:27
We've got a few hours, uh, writing in a carriage, or…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:31
Um, in an airplane, or whatever we do nowadays.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:35
Um, so that was what I wanted to say. Thanks.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:24:39
Thanks, Pete. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:24:41
Stacy.

[Stacey Druss] 08:24:45
Thanks, Peter. I have to address what you said first, or maybe second.

[Stacey Druss] 08:24:52
Yeah, I'll do… I'll do that after.

[Stacey Druss] 08:24:56
Um, or maybe… you maybe have to get that out of the way first.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:01
I'm just on the other side of, um…

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:04
Yeah. Curiosity when it's not genuine,

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:08
can also be really annoying.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:12
It's, it's like…

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:14
Yeah, let me just get that off my chest.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:17
Because it… at least for…

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:21
Me…

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:25
I don't know if it's… if I want to say as a woman or not.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:30
As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:25:35
Mm-hmm.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:36
Sometimes curiosity

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:38
can feel like I have to explain myself.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:41
So I just want to put that out there.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:43
And…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:25:43
It feels like prying.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:44
Genuinely… say it again?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:25:46
It feels like prying, you mean, or…?

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:48
Yeah, or, or, like, having to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:54
When it's genuine, it's wonderful.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:25:56
Mm-hmm.

[Stacey Druss] 08:25:57
There's nothing…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:57
And if I may, when I learned

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:00
this kind of social curiosity from Joanne.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:03
Her observation, as a woman, was…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:07
men are acculturated to not be curious, especially about women, about lots of stuff, right? And so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:13
in a way, it was a kind of women's work, that she doesn't mind doing because it's not the worst

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:18
thing that women have to do in this world. Um, but…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:21
She was always… she felt like she was always the one who were like, you know, it's not that hard, guys.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:28
Uh, just ask questions. And you're entirely correct. Insincere.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:34
Uh, curiosity is worse than just shutting up. However,

[Stacey Druss] 08:26:37
Yeah.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:39
I would also say, um, it's…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:42
It's not hard at all to learn to ask humbly and be genuinely interested in the answer.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:48
Where did you grow up? You know, it's not…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:51
it's… it's, uh… I can ask that question and not care about the answer, but…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:26:56
It's not hard as a social practice for me to say, I really do care where you grew up.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:03
And I hope you ask if… where I grew up, too, but, you know, if you don't, I understand that you're not

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:09
You're not as careful as I am, or you're not as polite, or whatever, I'm gonna, like, shine that on. And I know women have to do that a lot more than men, so…

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:17
Yeah. And you know me, I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do.

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:23
I'm sorry, anybody. I don't pro… I probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:28
Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy. But, you know, there's a set of, like, 5 questions that even, uh…

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:30
Forgive me! Forgive me.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:35
A man can learn, you know, ask this question, really care about the answer, and there's probably a follow-up question, you know?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:42
Where did you go to school? You know, it's…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:44
pretty simple to do. Go ahead, I'm sorry to have interrupted you.

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:45
Okay, anyway, let me, let me, let me say what I really wanted to say.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:27:49
Now, now I'm curious what you're going to say.

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:50
Um

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:53
Okay, this is what I want to say. I want to go back to…

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:55
I want to connect to where Gil was speaking.

[Stacey Druss] 08:27:58
Because I… so I was reminded of, um…

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:01
George Mombia, where he says,

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:04
Where we don't have a story, we make up one. And I want to connect to Gil's stories.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:10
So, when he was speaking about, like, coaching and…

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:15
I was thinking, so the people that don't ask questions then,

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:21
the story that I made up in my mind,

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:23
is that sometimes people that are either younger

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:27
or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:32
But they might be less experienced.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:34
Sometimes they haven't had the space to talk.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:38
And so they don't want to ask questions

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:40
And here, experience, because they are just dying to have somebody hear them.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:47
So I want to throw that out.

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:49
Um, and as far as the people that were talking to Jane,

[Stacey Druss] 08:28:55
Sometimes people are afraid to hear the answers, and they're so uncomfortable.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:00
with sickness, and they don't want to know.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:03
And I wanted to throw that out, too, because sometimes really caring, loving people

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:10
are just so uncomfortable with feelings, and don't know what to say.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:15
And that calls in, you know, the curiosity kind of killed the cat thing, so sometimes we don't ask questions. Well, I'm looking at the lawyer in the corner. Doug, you're in the corner, and it's like, don't ask the question that you don't know the answer to.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:30
So, um, those are some stories that came… some possible stories

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:36
Um, I tend to be somebody… I will ask the question,

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:40
Because I don't want to make up a story in my head.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:43
It's usually, I've found in my life, it's better to ask the question and know for sure.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:48
than to just imagine what the answer is.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:51
And do I have any other quest… any… okay, I think… I think I covered everything I wanted to say.

[Stacey Druss] 08:29:56
Over.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:29:57
Yay! Thank you, Stacey. You're reminding me of a conversation I'm having on LinkedIn, where I put a post in about futurists and future visions and…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:04
how they're all kind of crappy. And a friend of mine posted in the comments,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:09
about, um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:11
Maybe we don't need future visions. Maybe what we need is to be really present.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:16
And it kind of flipped the game on me, and it was really interesting, because I find that

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:21
whatever model I have of where we're going, and the competing models of where we're going, I love that conversation and that battle.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:28
But I also find that my behavior changes enormously depending on what I think

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:33
what I think I want in the future. I need those visions in order to figure out what…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:38
how to be present.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:40
And so, I haven't seen her response to that, but we're in the middle of that conversation right now. It's kind of cool.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:30:45
Mr. Jones, thanks for your patience.

[Kevin Jones] 08:30:48
Well, you know, I think my success in life has been based on not paying attention in school.

[Kevin Jones] 08:30:54
Because I never could figure out what they wanted, and it didn't seem like much.

[Kevin Jones] 08:30:57
But then when I got into business, I understood I was in a fluid dynamic system that people were passionate about, and they were making things and buying things and selling things, and I… it was my briar patch.

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:07
And I'm running my friend Ben Santer and his story, I think, is really relevant.

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:12
He was a PhD candidate who failed 3 times and was working in day labor in Seattle.

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:21
Uh, and, uh, the one professor who still believed in him got him a gig,

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:27
of copying, uh, maps in an ag weather, uh,

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:31
company. And he suddenly understood climate, and it was a big enough thing, just like school wasn't big enough, climate was.

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:39
He was the author of the first UN report on climate,

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:42
And one of the reasons he was the author is he had a really, you know, his ego was really in check, because he remembered he…

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:49
If you hadn't had that one-day labor come through, he would still be

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:53
you know, day laborers don't stay

[Kevin Jones] 08:31:56
very stable. And so he was the one everybody trusted, and it was only when he… he just saw…

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:02
you know, a weather map of Kansas,

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:05
And, you know, what was going to happen to corn, and suddenly understood the system he was in. And, you know, he and I are similar in that way.

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:12
is that, you know, again, not paying attention to school was a great gift.

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:17
Um, and… because I found the place where I did fit, you know, it was a…

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:23
fluid, dynamic system, you know, with elements of reciprocity, and so…

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:30
Ben was the same way. So I think, you know…

[Kevin Jones] 08:32:33
I think you have to survive school, but I don't see people lower… you know, it's just, they hadn't found the, you know, their briar patch. That's what I think.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:32:43
Hmm. Thanks, Kevin.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:32:45
Scott?

[Scott Moehring] 08:32:51
I want to throw a scatterbomb of different…

[Scott Moehring] 08:32:54
ideas, so I'm looking for a theme here.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:32:55
Excellent.

[Scott Moehring] 08:32:58
All right, this is one I don't…

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:00
No.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:02
I like this idea that Pete had brought up about

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:06
asking people. I do it all the time.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:09
I talked to the people at the checkout line.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:11
In the grocery store, and things like that.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:15
Um, I like to think

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:18
As a 59-year-old, that I'm not that creepy old guy.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:22
that I'm actually sincere, that I'm actually… we have a pleasant exchange, that I know a little something about them,

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:29
what they're like, and it's… it's…

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:31
It's better than a simply pure transactional.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:36
I'm wondering, and this is the part that I don't know, is…

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:43
Are we…

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:45
Are young people being raised to

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:46
not do that, because…

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:52
We don't want to discriminate.

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:53
based on any of the discrimination

[Scott Moehring] 08:33:57
factors that we shouldn't discriminate on, and that

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:00
We shouldn't be intrusive, as you said, and that the idea of…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:05
sharing things about yourself.

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:07
is more often, or can be used, especially online,

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:11
For insult, rather than connection.

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:14
And we're going to seek to avoid pain more than we are…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:19
towards pleasure.

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:21
And the internet's forever.

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:24
You know, and so online, if you share personal things about yourself,

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:31
They're… they're generally unneeded for the conversation that you're having, because it's about some other topic.

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:36
Or it's not germane. And…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:39
It can be used against you, and maybe you… maybe…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:42
That's part of it, personally, and the other part is that maybe we're taught, don't…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:46
Don't ask those things. We are not supposed to…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:50
inquire about…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:51
race and religion and gender and all of those things, because it's…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:55
it caused trouble, and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:34:59
the last thought that I had that was all connected into that was that I…

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:03
Met my wife online.

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:05
And I say often that it was the best thing.

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:09
the best thing, because I had to meet the person.

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:12
Before I could meet the person.

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:16
And it… it's stripped away all the… all the other stuff. I just had to…

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:21
I had to get to know this individual.

[Scott Moehring] 08:35:24
And it has worked out extremely well because of that.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:35:33
Thanks, Scott. And Victoria.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:35:39
I just wanted to make a real…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:35:43
follow up on this conversation about carrying?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:35:47
By presenting you all my friend Gabrielle,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:35:50
Who has to join us, because this morning we were… we were walking together,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:35:57
he in Italy, in Spain, but we were working together.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:01
And I asked… I told him about this session, and since he's young,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:07
So, this is a different perspective.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:10
And since he's studying to be a teacher or help

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:15
people learn. I thought it was…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:18
important that we can hear his voice, even if he's not raising the hand.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:36:26
That's odd.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:36:27
Victoria, thank you very much, and I was… I was sort of looking for a place to say hi to Gabriele.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:36:32
And, uh, let him jump in. If you'd like to say anything or just introduce yourself, please feel free right now.

[Gabriele G] 08:36:38
Okay, thank you. It's so curious to be here.

[Gabriele G] 08:36:43
Just the connection that happens through internet.

[Gabriele G] 08:36:47
It's, uh, outstanding to me.

[Gabriele G] 08:36:49
I'm glad to hear your conversation. By now, I don't want to jump in, because, uh…

[Gabriele G] 08:36:58
I… I…

[Gabriele G] 08:37:00
Still trying to put my toes in order.

[Gabriele G] 08:37:05
But it's really…

[Gabriele G] 08:37:11
good things to be here. So, thank you for having, uh, opened your door, internet door, for me now.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:37:19
That's great, thank you. What city in Italy are you in?

[Gabriele G] 08:37:23
I am Padua, near Venice.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:37:26
Very cool. Thank you, thank you so much.

[Gabriele G] 08:37:27
Pardo.

[Gabriele G] 08:37:29
Thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:37:30
Um, cool. Uh, LP1, are you Don Bergen or Louise King, or…?

[LP1] 08:37:37
Louise, hello everyone.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:37:38
You are Louise, okay, you look so much like my friend Don, that's very funny. Thanks for joining us, Louise.

[LP1] 08:37:41
Okay. Um, yes, and I've joined today because I am, um, teaching, I'm teaching in an international section in a French lisse.

[LP1] 08:37:50
Um, and, um, I'm trying to decide whether I am seeing a decline in curiosity and confidence in my classroom,

[LP1] 08:38:01
or whether it's just I'm getting old. Um, we always hear that from, from, um,

[LP1] 08:38:07
Uh, you know, the previous generation or the young people today, um, they're not curious, they're not whatever.

[LP1] 08:38:14
Um, but I would say that the last couple of years, I have really begun to wonder

[LP1] 08:38:22
If it's me or if it's them. Um, some of the things I see is I do see

[LP1] 08:38:28
Many students lacking in confidence, they're asking some of the most basic things. Can I use color miss? Can I use whiteout?

[LP1] 08:38:37
Should I underline? Should I… and it's like, I have to say to them, you can make those decisions. They aren't…

[LP1] 08:38:46
challenging decisions. They're not important decisions.

[LP1] 08:38:49
You can make those for yourself.

[LP1] 08:38:51
And I am seeing this anxiety of them, um, you know, making the simplest of moves.

[LP1] 08:38:58
Um, the other one is, um…

[LP1] 08:39:02
I really think I've seen a decline in attention.

[LP1] 08:39:05
Um, and, uh, focus and involvement in tasks.

[LP1] 08:39:11
Um, I was reflecting on a particular class that I gave an assessment to recently, and I've done the same assessment, perhaps, for the past 4 or 5 years, and literally, it's the very worst.

[LP1] 08:39:24
performance I've ever had. So I'm the same teacher in the room,

[LP1] 08:39:27
And this is a really cool performance across… I know there are lots of factors there.

[LP1] 08:39:32
Um, so that's one of the reasons I'm here. I've… I've got a bit of a thing about technology. I'm a maths teacher.

[LP1] 08:39:39
And definitely with the use of calculators, I've seen a great decline in students' mental abilities.

[LP1] 08:39:46
Now, there is the feeling that that doesn't matter, they're using calculators, and as long as they can still think mathematically, it doesn't matter if they're not doing calculations, or they're not graphing, or they're not.

[LP1] 08:39:56
But I wonder if it does diminish their mental capacity for understanding if they haven't done it themselves.

[LP1] 08:40:04
So now I see them using ChatGB… a chat GPT to, um, literally write their essays.

[LP1] 08:40:11
We're going to see a decline in the skills of writing, of expressing their ideas, um, in the written word.

[LP1] 08:40:19
Um, although, again, you could argue, does that matter? We're moving away from the printed word, we're moving back to, um, video, to the spoken word, spreading ideas through the spoken word. So, is it important if they can no longer

[LP1] 08:40:34
Right. So I'm full of all these… these questions about my situation,

[LP1] 08:40:40
Um, I did… I did have that thought that, because I see this, is curiosity innate?

[LP1] 08:40:46
Or can we teach it? I try to teach problem solving. I see some students who are just there, they just… they just have ideas, they try them out,

[LP1] 08:40:56
It doesn't work, they'll try something different, they might be asking questions,

[LP1] 08:41:00
And I see other students who simply are there going, I don't know what to do.

[LP1] 08:41:04
And I have never seen myself, despite… I've tried hard, I've tried different methods, I've never seen a student learn how to problem solve. They either seem to have it,

[LP1] 08:41:14
Or they don't. Um, they might be really great at lots of other things, so that's brilliant, but they're not… they're not doing that aspect of it.

[LP1] 08:41:23
Um, I'm sorry to go on, but I've got a couple of other things to say.

[LP1] 08:41:27
I'm somebody…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:27
Please, can you tell us what… can you tell us what grade you teach, just so I can…

[LP1] 08:41:30
I take… I don't know what… I don't know what the French grades are, just let me tell you, I teach from… I teach 11-year-olds through to 17-year-olds.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:39
Thank you, please continue.

[LP1] 08:41:41
Um, I was, um, we've been talking about the curiosity and social situations as well. I have a very poor memory

[LP1] 08:41:48
for vocabulary. I have to be immersed in a vocabulary for quite a long time. I'm probably dyslexic, but too old to have had any, um…

[LP1] 08:41:58
certification.

[LP1] 08:41:59
I dread talking to people and trying to be curious about them, because I won't remember the details, and the worst thing that can happen to me is I meet them again, so if I meet any of you again,

[LP1] 08:42:09
I can't remember the name, I can't remember where they lived. They've told me all these things about them, and for that sort of detail, my head is a sieve. So I think there are all sorts of things, if you're talking about curiosity in social situations, you've got your culture, you've got your upbringing, and you've got your confidence in, you know, maintaining those relationships, uh,

[LP1] 08:42:30
over… over a period of time. So…

[LP1] 08:42:32
Um, uh, maybe that's enough from me. Thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:36
That's delightful. Luis, thank you for joining us. You reminded me that sitting behind me is my dad's old slide rule.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:43
And, uh, that I once…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:45
many, many, many years ago in my youth knew how to run it, and…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:49
and understood, because my dad had sort of approached it that way, that the slide rule is a fantastic way to estimate things, that

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:55
that engineers were able to just quickly ballpark things.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:58
Uh, to do the… is it Fermi?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:00
One of the physicists was Feynman, Fermi, one of those,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:04
who was really good at, sort of, quick estimations of large-scale things, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:09
We're kind of losing that as well.

[LP1] 08:43:11
young students can't do mental arithmetic, um, they just don't understand.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:12
Um…

[LP1] 08:43:17
And they think I'm a genius because I can do mental arithmetic on the board while I'm solving problems.

[LP1] 08:43:23
I mean, they're in war.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:23
Have you seen the movie Idiocracy?

[LP1] 08:43:26
I haven't. I'll look it out.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:43:27
Just so I… Aaron.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:27
Yeah, it's… it's, alas, a little bit too topical for what we're talking about.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:32
You know, in the future, one guy wakes up from a cryogen… an accidental cryogenic sleep, and suddenly it turns out he's the smartest human on the…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:40
In the country, so they make him president, because he's the only one who knows, like, the most primitive things. It's a dark comedy, but uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:48
You'll unfortunately probably enjoy it because of your setting.

[LP1] 08:43:48
Right.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:52
Um, uh, Doug, please.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:43:58
I, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:02
I… I can't help but, sort of,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:06
feel that the question…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:08
is sort of a straw man.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:11
Because it's… it's… am I…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:15
judging somebody else not being curious enough is what's really being…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:23
And…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:25
And the underlying… the underlying active ingredient

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:31
to me, is connection.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:36
And if somebody is… is… if I'm not in connection with the person I'm talking to,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:49
then there's… there's really no way to… to, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:55
to engage.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:44:59
And my experience with…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:05
My experience with younger folk is sort of… is a little bit bivalent.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:09
My son, who's around 30,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:13
is, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:15
in some undiagnosed way, because he defied all testing, he's, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:21
neurodivergent, and he falls into that category of…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:26
Hypersocial. Like, the quintessential salesman.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:29
Um, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:31
he's endlessly curious. He is always either asking questions, or…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:37
or, you know, going into…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:40
gymnastics, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:42
you know, has Ulysses-like status in the company he works in, because

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:47
people have seen him repairing his own flat tires.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:51
Which captures this last point that was just made, that, you know, like…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:56
he learned how to do that, and somebody…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:45:59
you know, his peers think.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:01
That's insanely amazing that he knows how to do that.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:05
And, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:08
Conversely,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:11
Um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:13
there's a rationality to…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:16
younger people…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:18
being disconnected because of the insanity of the educational system they're subjected to.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:46:26
So, so you're saying partly this could be a rational response to a really crappy system they're embedded in.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:26
And the difference is that

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:31
to a really insane world that they're staring at and going, what am I, you know, what am I supposed to do with this?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:46:35
Yeah.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:38
How am I supposed to respond to this?

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:40
And I do think there is a…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:43
you know, as much as they may not

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:46
have basic underlying skills that we have, because we're…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:49
creatures of the, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:52
20th century.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:55
that, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:46:57
They do have a clarity and awareness.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:00
of their world and their position in it.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:03
And there's a certain level of agency and empowerment

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:11
Um, that also came with the fact that, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:13
They get what they want when they want it, what they're not interested in, they're not interested in, what they are interested in. They are interested in, everything's immediate gratification, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:22
They're the kings and queens of their own domain.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:25
via their screens.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:47:27
Hmm.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:27
And they're… so their whole orientation and experience

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:31
of the world, uh, is a completely different, like, you know, Stranger in a Strange Land compared to my orientation.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:39
So it's a different world, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:43
My curiosity…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:46
And that is to try to get to their understanding and perspective.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:50
an experience of it.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:53
Um, and wanting to know that, wanting to understand that.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:47:57
from the inside out, not from the outside looking at.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:48:03
So I just… I just wanted to toss that into

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:06
Doug, thank you for layering in a bunch of really interesting other perspectives on the question. I mean, the…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:12
You've got me thinking, is curiosity a superficial trait?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:17
Uh, and connection is the thing we seek, and, you know, in that sense, do we need to be talking and inquiring and inquisitive in order to connect?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:25
And I don't think… I think the answer is, no, we don't. We can actually connect without those things.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:31
sometimes really deeply.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:34
there's all kinds of interesting questions on the table. Judy?

[Judith Benham] 08:48:38
Well, I was…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:38
Off to you.

[Judith Benham] 08:48:41
I need to… I need to unmute.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:48:43
No, you're already unmuted, we hear you.

[Judith Benham] 08:48:44
Oh, okay, um…

[Judith Benham] 08:48:46
I think it's a really complicated topic in the sense that

[Judith Benham] 08:48:50
there's intrinsic and extrinsic curiosity, and it can be enabled or…

[Judith Benham] 08:48:56
made less popular by circumstantial situations, so…

[Judith Benham] 08:49:01
we might want to scope this out more broadly, because I think there's a lot of intrinsic curiosity, but it can be stifled very easily if people are put down for asking questions or such.

[Judith Benham] 08:49:12
And I know I was a hugely curious kid, and so I… I did get suppressive comments at times.

[Judith Benham] 08:49:20
Fortunately, I got reinforcing behaviors from my family structure, so I persisted.

[Judith Benham] 08:49:26
But I think that this is a really important topic, because it's not just curiosity per se, it's acquisition of knowledge and the process of gaining perspective.

[Judith Benham] 08:49:36
From examining the full scope and breadth of a topic, and I think

[Judith Benham] 08:49:41
That's a bigger question for me in the educational system right now, because I don't think we're encouraging

[Judith Benham] 08:49:48
That type of in-depth consideration of

[Judith Benham] 08:49:53
opposite points of view, for instance. If you think, A, well, what is the opposite of a position?

[Judith Benham] 08:49:58
What are all the positions in between? How do you sort that out to find what seems to be the best? And that's different than sort of intrinsic curiosity, which I think small children have, but it can be stifled.

[Judith Benham] 08:50:11
I'll just stop there.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:50:12
Love that. And you were fortunate to grow up in an environment, in a family, that sort of counteracted

[Jerry Michalski] 08:50:20
other stimuli, which is great.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:50:23
Thanks, Judy. Klaus.

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:27
But we are talking about different types of curiosity, so there's this interpersonal curiosity,

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:34
Which is really very cultural. I mean,

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:38
I worked for Disney for 21 years, and then we moved to the Hong Kong project,

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:43
We've got set up with a relocation service, and they started us out with a book called Culture Shock Hong Kong.

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:52
And, uh, gave us, you know, an in-depth, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 08:50:57
briefing on what to say and not to say to people.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:01
Um, then I went to Germany from there, after 21 years with Disney.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:06
Um, and worked for a very large German corporation, Metro.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:11
in the corporate office.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:14
I was just shocked what people would ask me, you know, I mean…

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:19
I mean, it was just… it was just so off the wall from an American perspective, very personal questions.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:26
That, uh, if you ask that in an American, you would be considered

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:31
wood, you know? So, so there is this interpersonal, which is very cultural, and then we operated in 30 countries.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:39
So, I mean, I would have… I would go to India, to China, to Russia,

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:45
Romania, Italy, Spain, right?

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:47
And it's really very unique how, how, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:51
People have basic expectations about what you should be curious about, and where the lines are.

[Klaus Mager] 08:51:58
But then there's this other curiosity about your world, your profession, just the…

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:05
The world around you, you know, the society you live in, the political life.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:10
And to want to have a better understanding of that.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:15
And I think the information…

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:18
we have available today.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:19
is so amazingly more, you know, than there ever was.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:25
Um, because of social media and because of the access to

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:30
the internet and all of that.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:32
Uh, and I… it's probably overwhelming now for, for, uh, particularly younger people who haven't found

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:40
a foundation yet to know themselves more, yeah?

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:45
And to be more secure in their own… in their own being.

[Klaus Mager] 08:52:52
Um, so I don't know if we can randomly say that curiosity is less than what it used to be, because the world has just… the world around us has just changed so much, you know, and the information is so focused and so concentrated.

[Klaus Mager] 08:53:06
It's so available now.

[Klaus Mager] 08:53:08
that, uh, I don't think we can even begin to compare ourselves to someone who lived 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:53:16
Yeah. Um, Doug was starting that piece of the conversation about maybe kids today are growing up in a…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:53:23
Such a dramatically different world, and we're trying to apply archaic ideas about curiosity to

[Jerry Michalski] 08:53:29
a completely different environment. That's a…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:53:32
an interesting take. Eve, please.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:53:34
Dang.

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:36
Okay, um, wonderful to see everyone here.

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:39
Um, well, if you'll…

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:42
be so kind to let me share, uh,

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:46
and integrate something else I've been thinking about.

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:49
Um, another angle to curiosity…

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:52
Um, and thinking about the world as it's reshaped by loss of norms and migration and digital life and…

[Eve Blossom] 08:53:58
Climate shifts, um, our sense of place,

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:03
is more about the connections and meanings we choose

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:07
Um, so curiosity intersects with this sense of place. My background is architecture,

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:14
Um, that keeps our sense of place alive rather than static. And…

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:19
one where we continually rediscover what grounds us and…

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:23
challenges us and expands our sense of who we are in relation to the world.

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:27
So, for many, maybe 15 to 25-year-olds,

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:30
Maybe it's the sense of place is shaped as much by their digital communities and global influences.

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:36
As by their immediate surroundings, and…

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:39
It's so different than how we all grew up, like, in the 70s, when I grew up.

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:43
Living somatically, going to the creek.

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:46
Looking at the tadpoles,

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:48
Um, you know, um, learning about things, uh, by hiking or walking, and…

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:54
Um, living in our bodies, in our own physical contexts.

[Eve Blossom] 08:54:58
Um, so I just think it's so different. Anyway, I just want to bring up this sense of place.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:55:04
Hmm. Thank you very much.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:55:09
Uh, Gil?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:13
Yeah, I've been… I've been listening to that very thing, Eve.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:17
context, uh, throughout this whole conversation. Context and norms, uh, is what's been echoing me throughout this, and um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:25
And I'm hearing Ken Homer, who's not here yet, uh, with this question, his ever-present question about who's we.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:32
And the corollary question of who's they?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:36
which has been throughout this whole conversation, where, you know, there's a whole we and they thing going on here, and it's very not specific. Um, and it's very relevant, because we're talking about conversations with people who are other in some sort of way.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:48
you know, different gender, different generation, different geography, different life experience.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:55:52
Different schooling, different roles, and so forth. Um, so it's something about our expectations across those differences.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:02
Uh, and the acculturation.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:04
Um, the norms, I've… I…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:07
Pride and Prejudice has been rolling in my mind.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:10
Hmm.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:10
As we're talking here. You know, where there was a richly nurtured culture of propriety and manners and how to speak, and how not to speak.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:23
And it's different across different classes, not just between the lords and the servants, but between the landowners and the middle class and the tradespeople in town. They're very different patterns of relationship.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:34
And speech and expectation, and what could be asked for. And LP1, I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:41
Louise.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:42
Louise.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:42
Luis? Yeah, hi, Louise. Um, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:47
You know, you talked about how the French are very direct.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:50
But the French are different in different parts of France, as the Americans are very different in different parts of the United States.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:56:55
Trust me, I grew up in New York, and I live in the Bay Area. You know, really different standards and practices about what you talk about and what you don't, and what you can ask about and what you can't.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:57:05
So, so, all of which is to say that the we who is… who… who…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:57:10
The we who is raising the question in this conversation, and the they who we are talking about,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:57:15
is a very important and unstated part of this conversation.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:57:22
Thanks, Gil. Um, if you want to… if you want to perf…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:57:24
And it's very…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:57:25
very fluid. Sorry.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:57:27
If you want to deepen your own perceptions of the we's and theys,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:57:31
Please feel free, because…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:57:33
As always, the elaboration helps us.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:57:36
Kevin, please.

[Kevin Jones] 08:57:38
Yeah, you know, Gil's…

[Kevin Jones] 08:57:40
comment is actually really right on to where I was going.

[Kevin Jones] 08:57:44
I worked with a friend with the Eastern Band Cherokee, and we were

[Kevin Jones] 08:57:49
working on a new product development for them that would diversify their income past casinos.

[Kevin Jones] 08:57:56
And, uh, we created a thing with them for the Taste of Cherokee, and they had some

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:03
vegetables that were… have been cultivated that had been domesticated, that they could brand.

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:09
And, uh, but the question that they came back with, and they took forever because tribes do,

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:14
They realized that they did not want to make

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:19
food, and it was the Taste of Cherokee, right? That was the thing. They said they didn't want to be, uh, make food a commodity. It should be something where if someone is hungry,

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:28
And they come to your door, you feed them. They said that, you know, on the other hand, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:33
would have done it. They're more transactional tribes.

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:37
But the question that…

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:39
The charity always asks,

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:41
Especially when you're dealing with a ketua band of Cherokee, which are the more traditional and creative.

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:46
is what does this decision make us in the world?

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:51
under the standpoint of reciprocity, and it's like,

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:55
oh, this turns…

[Kevin Jones] 08:58:57
feeding people into a commodity thing, and we sell it, and, you know, they sell their crops.

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:04
Double weave baskets can sell for a couple thousand dollars, because they're…

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:07
that can hold water, they're amazing.

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:10
Um, but…

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:12
I haven't seen other groups say, what does this decision make us? Because, you know,

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:17
This was going to do a lot for them. You know, they…

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:21
have to see no revenue, and they don't have a lot of other revenue, and uh…

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:26
But they turned down the chance to make

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:29
to have a really popular brand in western North Carolina.

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:32
Because it… it would make them something that they don't want to be. But it takes a tribe in a circle a long time to make that decision, and so when you're dealing with them,

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:42
you know, the fastest way to get things done and work with a tribe is to have all the time in the world.

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:47
And so we had posters made up, we had labels, and they just threw them away.

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:53
I mean, it was their dollar, but it was a…

[Kevin Jones] 08:59:55
So that's… that's an interesting question, and I don't… I don't see white folks asking that question much.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:02
Um, Kevin, thank you for the story. It seems like they went…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:00:03
It's, uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:05
They went deep into their culture.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:08
and thought about what were the influences or effects on their culture of this kind of decision, where we have…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:15
been born into and have assumed away and normalized a transactional environment.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:20
that does the opposite of what they were trying to do.

[Kevin Jones] 09:00:23
Yeah, and the Cherokee often want a Choctaw to run their business, because the Choctaw…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:28
Prah! That's hilarious.

[Kevin Jones] 09:00:29
much more transactional commercial folks.

[Kevin Jones] 09:00:32
Uh, just…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:32
That's like having a Shabbos goi turned on and off, turn your switches on and off on Shabbat.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:37
Very cool.

[Kevin Jones] 09:00:38
Something like that. It's, it's, yeah, they, they…

[Kevin Jones] 09:00:40
They don't think transactionally well. The Choctaw have always done that, and I could go further into the Choctaw, but yeah.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:00:49
Thank you so much for that story. Gil, please.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:00:52
It's a wonderful story, Kevin, thank you. And the what does this decision make us is a question that's going to be resonating with me for a while, so thank you for that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:03
It's a great example of how

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:06
how contextual this whole conversation is, because, you know, I would… I might assume something about Native American culture, but no, Cherokee different than Choctaw.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:14
No, actually, within Cherokee, differences within, you know,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:16
So, all of that situational.

[Kevin Jones] 09:01:18
Yeah, and Cherokee Nation is much more transactional than Eastern Bend and Cotua.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:23
Yeah, and you say, but even within Cherokee Nation, there's going to be differences in the different…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:28
formations that people have, and I'm struck that

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:31
If I were in conversation with that tribe, talking, you know, if I were you in that situation, and asked

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:40
Um, hey guys, what's going on? Haven't heard from you for a while, being curious about the process of the transaction. That would have been very unwelcome.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:46
And not helpful.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:48
Whereas in another setting, I'm at a SOCAP conference, you might ask that question to somebody.

[Kevin Jones] 09:01:53
Yep, yep. Yeah, the fastest way to go slower with the tribe is to probe.

[Judith Benham] 09:01:55
Great.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:01:58
Mm-hmm. Probe how, what does that mean?

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:02
is to probe, you know, to say, hey, what's up?

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:05
You know, it's like, they've said they're going off to think about it.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:08
Oh, okay, so you're saying, yeah, that will slow things down. I gotcha.

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:12
Right, like, you don't get welcome to the camp if you come into the camp.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:12
Right.

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:17
get visible.

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:19
And then you wait, and you get invited when it's time to invite you. I mean, it's that kind of…

[Kevin Jones] 09:02:24
you know, drives me fucking crazy, but, you know, that's what you have to do.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:27
Yeah. I had a friend years ago who, um, lived in…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:33
I guess northwestern Maryland.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:35
very rural northwestern Maryland.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:37
And their family had been there for 20 years before they had a conversation with somebody, not on their front porch, but in their house.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:45
20 years before they were invited in from the porch into the house.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:02:45
Hmm.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:50
Completely friendly, you know, friendly conversations on the porch, but that's where it was.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:02:55
Until… something opened.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:02:55
It's a whole new perspective on slow to warm up.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:01
Um…

[Kevin Jones] 09:03:02
just toss this quickly in, and my friends in Barcelona say they get invited to cafes, but not to the

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:03:07
There you go. Mm-hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:07
Hmm. Yeah, thanks. Our senses of what is… our intimacy gradient is a way of expressing this, like, who would you invite into your bedroom, to your living room, onto your porch?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:19
to your block party. There's a series of concentric rings,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:23
And each culture, and then within each person probably has different settings.

[Judith Benham] 09:03:23
Great.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:29
for, like, who gets to be where, and how… and what you…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:33
what the framing is for that particular ring. Like, oh, in this ring, it's okay to talk about

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:37
this kind of stuff, but not okay, you know, further out. All those kinds of things. And then there are people who just, like,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:43
Live their lives fully in public and have no rings, apparently.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:03:47
Uh, Alex.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:03:49
Hmm.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:03:53
Very, very interesting.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:03:55
I wanted to… I was very, sort of, I resonated with a lot of what Louise said, not about the teaching side.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:01
But about what things are, like…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:05
I'm… no insult intended.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:08
The chances are, if I see you in another Zoom group,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:11
I will not recognize any of you.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:13
Literally, you're different entities, and in my mind,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:17
it's a different set. I cannot recognize people.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:20
Uh, it's always a joke when going to the station, I go past neighbors and friends or whatever.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:26
Because I can… they're out of context to where they're supposed to be. So… so the reason… so it's a different mentality brain.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:33
But what, on the other side is, and a number of you have said it, is…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:37
I don't know how many of you have this feeling.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:39
I will not use anything, or do anything, or travel in anything where I don't

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:45
understand how it works.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:48
I know how cars work.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:50
I know how jets work.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:52
I have looked through the manual of a 747 jet engine when I was 15.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:04:57
Because I feel the need to know.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:00
I wouldn't get on a plane without knowing all this. I wonder how many other people feel like that, because

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:04
And that is the innet curiosity that some people have.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:08
And, uh, maybe I'm…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:12
like some people said, I've talked to everyone. I talk to everyone so much.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:16
I have no…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:19
no barrier. I will ask them anything, and some people, especially in Britain, the British people, a lot of them are very reserved.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:25
And, you know, there's not bad… not difficult to cross the barrier. You can ask about the weather, you can ask about…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:32
anything not important. But as soon as you ask anything remotely personal, it's just like…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:39
goes out of the window. And I kind of upset a lot of people, strangers, if that's okay.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:44
Um, one of the things I found interesting in talking to young people,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:50
And… but it's not just, you know, I just happen to be young people in one company I was working in. When we were doing Brexit in Britain,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:05:58
It was a big thing. Everybody was talking about it, took years to resolve.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:02
And I was sitting at lunch with some young people, they're all, like, 22, 23, 24.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:08
And I started talking about Brexit, you know, political, you know, being mean, insensitive, you know, I'll go in.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:14
And, to my surprise, they all turned round, the three of them, and said, we don't watch the news.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:21
I said, but it's a big thing, don't you care?

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:24
No, so did you vote? No.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:27
we just don't care.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:29
You know, so, like, they didn't say you don't care,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:31
We're just not interested. And that really profoundly shocked me, that there are people in this world

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:37
But I like that, so incurious.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:41
Um, on the one point about Louise and the AIs, what I want to say was, I'm one of those people

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:48
Because of the faces and everything else, I never understand. You can tell me something.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:53
you know, the teacher would tell me something, I could never understand it because my comprehension's not quite right, etc.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:06:58
And, um, I was too embarrassed to ask clarifying questions, because eventually it got really annoying.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:03
to the teacher. She'd answer the same question three times at different angles, and I still didn't get it.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:09
But do you know what? Since ChatGPT came along?

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:14
Oh, fantastic.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:15
I asked the same question in different ways, and eventually I understand it.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:20
And that is brilliant. And I wonder whether kids may actually benefit from that.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:25
So, because you don't… you don't feel like being… you're not going to be dumb asking the same question to an AI 50 different times.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:32
Um, but I just thought, I wonder whether that would improve things if you… if you have the teacher.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:38
and the AI to support

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:40
the teaching. And…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:07:44
That's it, thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:07:46
Thanks, Alex, very much. You reminded me of a little historical nugget. A friend of Kevin and mine, Joe Gouldy, who's a digital historian, wrote a book called Roads to Power.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:07:56
Which was about the first turnpikes in England.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:07:59
And before they started putting in turnpikes in England, nobody knew the whole country. There was no map of the whole country. You only knew the road to the next town.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:07
And when you start getting roads, you start getting carriage rides, and when you have carriage rides, it's the first time

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:13
You have strangers contained in a small space.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:16
So you have to invent things like, oh, lovely weather outside.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:21
That small talk is invented

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:24
Apparently, in that culture,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:26
for the close confines of long travel in a carriage.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:30
And it pervades cultures in all sorts of different ways, and probably showed up in other ways in other places, but it's cool.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:08:38
Clause, please.

[Klaus Mager] 09:08:40
Yeah, we have been reviewing individual curiosity.

[Klaus Mager] 09:08:45
But there's also a commons persona, you know, as people. So, Brexit is a great example. How was Brexit possible?

[Klaus Mager] 09:08:54
It's because there was…

[Klaus Mager] 09:08:57
uh…

[Klaus Mager] 09:08:59
a curiosity of the comments about what does this all imply, and what does it mean,

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:05
And where should we be drifting, and where should we be going?

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:09
So the… looking at this not just from an individual perspective, but from a commons perspective.

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:16
You know, from, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:19
where the majority is moving, moving around, and maybe having groups within.

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:24
the commons who have divergent opinions,

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:27
I mean, that's also… I mean, it's heavily cultural, but it's also…

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:34
a way to define curiosity.

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:38
You know, to… because the… the…

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:42
And I'm not quite sure how to really frame this, but…

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:46
The common mind is curious about and interested in information, and of course, it's being manipulated and

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:54
And messed around with.

[Klaus Mager] 09:09:57
And the reason why I'm so, so maybe more aware of it is because

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:03
Now, I've been working on climate change, I've been working on

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:06
getting people to understand food within the context of climate and environment.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:11
And there is a shift in public perception.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:15
You know, you can see that opinion bending towards

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:21
an understanding of health and of nutrition, and so on.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:26
And the impact on the environment.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:30
Um, but it's… it's, um… and… and I think the curiosity is there.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:36
But you're fighting these, these…

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:39
information streams that are contradicting each other, you know, and that are manipulated.

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:45
So how does that all play a role here? How does that…

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:49
You know, enter the idea of what is curiosity. You know, if you can't distinguish between

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:56
what's right and wrong, and uh…

[Klaus Mager] 09:10:59
Uh, not wanting to be misled, you know, having to have the trust.

[Klaus Mager] 09:11:03
to… to… towards an information source.

[Klaus Mager] 09:11:06
And then… and then, uh, commit yourself to that information source versus

[Klaus Mager] 09:11:12
Now, dismissing, you know, others.

[Klaus Mager] 09:11:14
So I think there is a… there are a lot of nuances here that…

[Klaus Mager] 09:11:18
that are a little bit more difficult to define.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:22
Absolutely, Klaus. You just opened up in my brain,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:27
sort of the QAnon and other conspiracy theorist comment of, I did… well, I did the research, or do your own research.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:34
And people going off onto the intertubes.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:37
and discovering God knows what, and this is sort of at that boundary between curiosity and critical thinking, but also misinformation, disinformation, et cetera, et cetera.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:45
And strangely enough, our collective sense-making, which is an incredibly OGM-y topic.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:52
part of the reason we're here is how do we… how do we make sense of our world together?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:56
Um, Scott, please.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:03
I am… want to do. I…

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:06
have an idea about…

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:08
a way to define curiosity, or one definition.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:11
And Scott, your volume seems to be really low. If you can lean toward your mic or turn up the gain or something, but keep going.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:14
Hmm.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:16
Alright, um, well, we'll just talk a little louder for a minute.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:22
Um…

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:23
Curiosity. Noticing things you don't…

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:27
didn't have to notice.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:29
I'm gonna put that in the chat. I just want to see…

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:32
If that resonates with anyone.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:34
I've been thinking about noticing, and that seems to fit.

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:40
What?

[Scott Moehring] 09:12:42
Well, curiosity. Noticing things you didn't have to notice.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:48
Thank you. Pete, please.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:12:54
I wanted to echo Alex's…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:12:58
discussion of not going in things that you don't know how they work. Um, I'm not quite that

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:04
that extreme, but I certainly…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:08
in a building, or in a city, or in a vehicle, or whatever, wherever I'm at,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:14
I usually know a lot about the infrastructure of it, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:20
And I feel a lot better about it because of that. Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:24
And it's… it's just a way I live. It's not…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:28
you know, it's… I don't feel like I'm super curious about things, or that I've got to find out stuff.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:34
Although, demonstrably, kind of, I am compared to other people. Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:40
Uh… and…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:42
I… I, uh, I'm gonna put a link to a Washington Post article, um, and I'm not gonna archive

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:48
ph at, um, you'll have to do that yourself, but it's…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:13:53
Washington Post found 47,000 conversations with ChatGPT that kind of spilled out onto the internet, and they've… they've collected them up and kind of went through them, so…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:04
What do people talk with ChatGPT about?

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:07
And some of the… some of the things were just, like, heart-stoppingly… heartbreaking.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:12
for me to read, because…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:15
When I'm using a chat system, a ChatGPT or Cloud or whatever, I know how it works, I know

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:21
why it does what it does, how, you know, I can predict, you know, not entirely accurately, but I can kind of predict.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:29
It's gonna be good at these things, it's gonna be bad at these things, it's going to pretend to be good at these things, and it's going to be wrong.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:36
And that doesn't freak me out, you know? It's like writing in a… in a…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:41
a jet airplane, and knowing

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:43
What kinds of things would break and are no big deal, and what kinds of things might seem like not a big deal, but they're huge, and, like, every… it's a disaster, right?

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:52
I know that kind of thing about jet airplanes, or cars, or buses, or, you know, uh…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:14:58
tall buildings, or whatever.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:00
Um, and so it…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:04
it… kind of terrifies me, thinking that people are using these…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:09
things that are able to ape human emotions effectively.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:15
Um, with… with absolutely no intent or… or care about what they're doing, because they cannot have care, not because they don't, you know, they don't…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:24
give a hoot. They can't.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:26
Um, but they pretend that they do, or they act like they do, in a way that confuses people, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:32
There's a bunch of people who don't know how, you know, AI works, and they get fooled by it, and they…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:37
They do all kinds of crazy things with it.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:40
This… it reminds me also, in a strange way, this… I'm going to say something that I feel like

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:45
is embarrassing to say in public. Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:49
Uh, I am pretty successful at using

[Pete Kaminski] 09:15:51
Don't do this at home, folks. I'm pretty successful at using ChatGPT as health advice. And I was thinking about that. I had a… I had a kind of a health scare. It ended up in the hospital for a few days. I spent a lot of time with ChatGPT.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:08
Uh, asking stupid questions of it, rather than a nurse, because nurses are busy doing other

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:13
more important things, apparently. Um, uh, no offense to nurses or even the medical system, but ChatGPT was a huge help to me, and I'm like,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:22
Okay, how can I tell people that I did this?

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:25
And I did it in a safe way.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:28
Because, just like jet airplanes and, you know, excavators and tall buildings, I know a lot about health systems, too. Health systems and my health, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:41
how… how medicine works, and I can understand an explanation from ChatGPT and ask

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:46
penetrating questions about, are you… are you sure that you thought about this or that, you know, in a way that I feel…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:53
safe to navigate with ChatGPT,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:16:55
giving me health advice. I wouldn't recommend that to most people, and again, don't do it at home.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:17:01
Um, but, uh, it's, uh, it was shocking meeting the Washington Post thing, going, oh my god, people are using these technologies and have no clue how it works, and they're getting tricked by it. Um, not because the thing is trying to trick it,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:17:14
Because they've… they're in a context where they don't have enough information about it.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:17:21
Thanks, Pete. Louise.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:17:21
Thanks.

[LP1] 09:17:24
Well, that's an interesting one for me to lead on to, because I do reflect on the use of AI.

[LP1] 09:17:31
Um, in an education environment.

[LP1] 09:17:34
I can see there would be so many benefits. I mean, I'm fortunate to have small classes of, say, 24 students,

[LP1] 09:17:42
But you can imagine trying to give those 24 students individual focused attention is very challenging.

[LP1] 09:17:49
But if they have an AI bot that can respond to them,

[LP1] 09:17:52
Which can lead them, which can assess them, and move them on.

[LP1] 09:17:58
We have individual students moving at an individual pace.

[LP1] 09:18:02
And I can see a huge benefit in that, but you've, um, it's Pete.

[LP1] 09:18:07
has given me, then, a lot of that concern, you know, we've got to have some confidence that that, um, AI is capable of doing that. Maybe in a focused, um,

[LP1] 09:18:18
on a focused topic or subject, you can have an AI that could lead students through a learning experience, and let them

[LP1] 09:18:27
Um, at their own pace, but also at their own level of curiosity, um, explore a subject.

[LP1] 09:18:34
Um, something the conversation has really highlighted for me, which is going to be beneficial when I'm teaching, is that this curiosity is so multifaceted.

[LP1] 09:18:45
that I may not recognize curiosity from a student about this particular maths lesson.

[LP1] 09:18:50
But they probably do have the curiosity in some area that's engrossing for them.

[LP1] 09:18:58
Um, and I may just not be aware of that. I mustn't judge them just in their… in the environment of curiosity in my classroom.

[LP1] 09:19:07
and maths. So that's been very helpful, um, today.

[LP1] 09:19:10
Um, one thing I might mention is if you are interested in Brexit, I don't know if you've seen the film, which I found very, um, enlightening, although I do appreciate

[LP1] 09:19:19
It's sort of a docudrama, where, um, Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dominic Cummings,

[LP1] 09:19:25
And, um, it explores the ways that, um,

[LP1] 09:19:29
They managed to influence and convince the public that, um, to exit was the vote.

[LP1] 09:19:37
So that's quite interesting to watch.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:19:41
Thank you so much, Luis. Excuse me.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:19:46
Oops, uh, John.

[* John Kelly] 09:19:48
Yeah.

[* John Kelly] 09:19:51
Okay, so…

[* John Kelly] 09:19:53
one of the ideas about Curiosity was,

[* John Kelly] 09:19:56
Noticing things that you don't absolutely have to notice.

[* John Kelly] 09:19:59
You may notice that I'm in a different context than I was earlier in the call.

[* John Kelly] 09:20:05
If you're curious…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:07
I'm actually in a hyperbaric chamber, and we're just under 2 atmospheres

[* John Kelly] 09:20:12
And about 46% oxygen.

[* John Kelly] 09:20:14
Which is, um…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:17
as nominally therapeutic benefits for both

[* John Kelly] 09:20:23
Certainly… conditions, certain disease conditions, but also…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:27
you know, as both a longevity or a cognitive enhancement, uh…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:31
tool, and that's how I'm using it.

[* John Kelly] 09:20:35
Um, and also to build on the comments about teaching,

[* John Kelly] 09:20:41
I taught different levels, you know.

[* John Kelly] 09:20:44
young kids, high school, college, and adults.

[* John Kelly] 09:20:49
And, uh,

[* John Kelly] 09:20:51
There are techniques which…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:53
If you thought this was curiosity, you would be…

[* John Kelly] 09:20:57
oversimplifying, on the one hand. On the other hand,

[* John Kelly] 09:21:01
they're quite powerful, particularly if

[* John Kelly] 09:21:04
you can, um, alter the social meaning of it. So, a classic one that

[* John Kelly] 09:21:10
all of us who have done any consulting, or even just people who are here, I mean, you've heard of the five wives things, where you just keep asking why,

[* John Kelly] 09:21:19
water. You basically take apart

[* John Kelly] 09:21:21
each answer…

[* John Kelly] 09:21:23
You don't accept it as, oh, that's not the… that's not the ultimate why, the other whys are underneath.

[* John Kelly] 09:21:33
That's just an example of one kind of question. I actually

[* John Kelly] 09:21:36
noticed in teaching that

[* John Kelly] 09:21:40
It's possible to over-focus on why.

[* John Kelly] 09:21:43
when you haven't done the previous work about what?

[* John Kelly] 09:21:46
And how. And how is a more neutral version of why?

[* John Kelly] 09:21:51
Y assumes, you know, why we tend to look for a motivation. We tend to look for a human actor and a motivation.

[* John Kelly] 09:21:56
And it's a good place to look, you know, if you're…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:00
If you're in a mystery story, or if you're in a, you know…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:05
Murder mystery or other kind of mysteries, but…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:08
There's other kinds of… kinds of collaborative coherence of, uh…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:13
causes, and you might not notice those unless you said how instead of why. And also, if you said what?

[* John Kelly] 09:22:20
First. And…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:22
What about the fact that students, and I had… I had plenty of

[* John Kelly] 09:22:26
militantly uncurious students.

[* John Kelly] 09:22:28
First genera… first-generation college.

[Kevin Jones] 09:22:28
Hmm.

[* John Kelly] 09:22:31
in a mill town,

[* John Kelly] 09:22:33
you know, their ideal, their career goal was to become a shop teacher.

[* John Kelly] 09:22:40
you know, they were… they were there…

[* John Kelly] 09:22:43
When I started talking about communication, they said, well,

[* John Kelly] 09:22:45
When are we going to laminate?

[* John Kelly] 09:22:47
And they had pictures of motorcycles and things like this they wanted to land. This is college. This is college.

[* John Kelly] 09:22:53
But it was… it was a shock to me, but I found that if you created a context in which

[* John Kelly] 09:22:58
There's a social reason

[* John Kelly] 09:23:02
for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the

[* John Kelly] 09:23:10
the benefit in terms of the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of

[* John Kelly] 09:23:15
say, oh, we actually, uh…

[* John Kelly] 09:23:18
discovered something that we weren't looking for, and we weren't particularly… if you'd told us

[* John Kelly] 09:23:22
But look for it, we would not have necessarily done it, but we did it in the context of…

[* John Kelly] 09:23:27
playing this little game, and as a result of playing the little game,

[* John Kelly] 09:23:31
we now have a different perspective.

[* John Kelly] 09:23:33
So… that's it.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:23:36
Thank you, John. Termint.

[Kevin Jones] 09:23:40
Yeah, you know, this is going from, don't try this at home,

[Kevin Jones] 09:23:45
And sort of part of my approach to life, or something.

[Kevin Jones] 09:23:49
About 25 years ago, I was in Rajasthan at a Mughal fort,

[Kevin Jones] 09:23:53
And there was a Fakir, who does, uh, you know, a random pattern to keep a cobra.

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:00
from going at him. And I've been told just a few weeks before by a woman that I was hard to follow in dance, so I wanted to see how it would be with the cobra.

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:10
So I bought a…

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:12
little pipe thing, you know, tube, whatever those things are.

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:16
And, uh, got a little closer, and so the COBRA focused on me, and it turned… I did my little funky thing, and within…

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:22
Less than 30 seconds, the cobra had me figured out better than Sean McConnell's wife had.

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:28
But I'd planned my exit well. I knew what to do with my right hand and with my left leg, and to spin behind, and so that he was in the line of fire, and my kids are watching me, and it's like…

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:38
I didn't have to tell them, don't try this, because they'd seen me, you know, do something, um…

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:44
But it was a great time… the moment of being eye-to-eye with a cobra,

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:48
is something I would do

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:50
And I don't regret doing.

[Kevin Jones] 09:24:52
But I'm glad they didn't think they needed to do it. So I'm really glad that my kids have not seen me as a role model.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:25:01
This is a good, non-replicable parenting moment.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:25:05
Thanks, Kevin.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:25:08
Stacy. Stacy, you're ending up in the queue after people saying incredible things, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:25:14
Good luck. Go ahead.

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:16
Thank you. Yeah, I just… I just wanted to say that

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:20
Um, I think we're… there's a little bit of a blurry line.

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:24
between the noticing and the curious, and I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious.

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:31
So, just saying that,

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:33
With the noticing, I do believe there are people that

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:38
They just don't notice.

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:40
And, like, they may not have the ability to notice, and so if you don't notice in the first place, you can't be curious.

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:48
Then there are people that notice

[Stacey Druss] 09:25:51
And they're not curious, and there's a difference there. So I just wanted to point that out.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:25:58
Thanks, Stacey. And, and, and…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:01
so much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:07
however you want to phrase that.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:10
And because only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue as you just described.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:16
We were very close to the end of our time together today, so I'm wondering if anybody has, uh,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:23
Victoria, did we miss things? Would you rather us have a more solid framework? I haven't been able to track the Excalibra.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:30
board very well, but I've…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:31
The Scalid row has been growing.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:34
And it can be opened

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:37
longer, so anybody who wants to continue the conversation there, that would be great.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:43
It's always great to have the conversation going on.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:47
I will say that…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:50
Um, I ask here in the chat if anyone knew about the question.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:56
formulation technique.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:26:58
That is, uh, methodology that the right question institute launched some years ago.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:05
I think we need to do something like that.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:10
with a good focus question.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:12
And start asking the questions first.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:16
And then, like, playing with…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:20
these questions, prioritize, and then decide what to do.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:25
Because I love the conversation, I've learned a lot.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:31
But I don't think we have really…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:36
start to uncover half of…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:38
what Curiosity is about.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:27:41
Because we were explaining our hypothesis instead of asking questions.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:27:47
Hmm, okay. Um, so the four rules for producing questions from…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:27:52
The question formulation technique, I'll just read them into the room so that we're aware, because I think you're suggesting we use this?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:27:59
Um, yeah, so the four…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:00
So, if you are, uh, if you want some combat, some…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:05
of the meeting could go like this, so just to practice.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:10
Um, so the four rules for producing questions are

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:13
Ask as many questions as you can.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:16
Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:20
Write down every question exactly as stated,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:23
And then change any statements into questions.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:27
That's the process. Um, and it would be fun to experiment with that.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:31
Victoria, have you… have you run any meetings or sessions where you've used this?

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:37
Uh, I was attending a seminar.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:41
more or less, very informal, just like this.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:44
among people who were interested in learning about Greek mythology.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:49
And the idea was that…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:52
We raised the theme, and one person was preparing the theme for the next session.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:28:57
And people would come with questions.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:01
Nobody did, nobody asked, of course.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:04
Until I suggested this…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:07
And then…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:09
we had so many questions, and we were able, like, to really

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:15
go in the direction we wanted,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:18
Because we ended with those lists of questions, prioritize them, decide what to do with them,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:28
Uh, some people were, like,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:30
For example, I want to invest to go further, uh, research,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:36
the…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:38
the hero hearing…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:41
uh… difference…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:42
I want to go through this other path, so…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:46
Each one decided

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:48
The next session, instead of having this, like,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:52
standardized sessions.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:54
Because they were the topics everybody talks about?

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:29:59
And it was really enriched in.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:02
enricher for everybody.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:05
So, maybe we can use it?

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:08
at least once?

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:11
to uncover anything we can,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:14
About curiosity, or about anything else that's not the… the issue is not the theme, it's…

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:20
that we practice with this.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:23
that maybe can bring something new to this…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:24
Mm-hmm.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:27
Conversations.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:29
Um, I like it. Uh, and I'm…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:31
Tempted to…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:33
go back to the topic of curiosity, or just shift around? I don't know…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:38
open to whatever anybody wants to suggest, but I think using this would be great.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:44
I think my… the immediate question that comes to mind is,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:46
At the end of this process, you have a… apparently a really long, great list of questions, then what do you do?

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:30:54
Now, the next steps, the question formulation technique does not end in the list of questions.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:00
Right? Okay.

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:31:01
It ends when you decide to prioritize the questions,

[Victoria (Spain)] 09:31:06
And what to do with the first three questions that are in your list?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:10
Awesome. Thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:14
Um, beautiful.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:16
So I… let's you and I talk about that some more, so we can sort of set this up. Anybody else who's interested, let us know on the OGM list.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:24
And, um…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:26
We don't have Ken for a while, he's stepped away from conversations like this for a bit, so we don't have a poem.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:32
from him at the end of the call, which is…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:35
Sad for me. But, uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:38
We'll be back in a week. So, thank you very much for a great call. That was… this was… this was…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:42
A terrific exploration, really appreciate it.

[Kevin Jones] 09:31:43
Thank you.

[Stacey Druss] 09:31:44
Wonderful, thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:46
Thank you all.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:48
Gabriele, welcome. Thanks, nice to see you.

[Gabriele G] 09:31:51
Thanks, thanks, thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:51
And Louise as well.

[Gabriele G] 09:31:53
Yeah, yeah, thank you, Jerry.

[Gabriele G] 09:31:55
I had some good, uh, insights from that.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:00
I'm really intrigued about this, um…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:03
Asking question things.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:05
So I'm going to read on something online.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:10
Or… how can I, um…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:14
You said that if…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:16
If I am interested, how can I…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:19
manifest those interests if you're going to do something about this.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:23
The question formulating, or, uh…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:27
Uh, in the future.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:27
So you… yeah, you are not yet on the OGM Google group, the mailing list that we use, so Victoria gave…

[Gabriele G] 09:32:33
No, I…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:35
Victoria gave me your email address. Is it okay if I add you to this… to the list?

[Gabriele G] 09:32:38
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:41
Sounds great. And then, so on that list is where we talk

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:43
That's our conversational space, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:46
Uh, that would be the place.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:47
Nice. Perfect.

[Stacey Druss] 09:32:47
Jerry? Jerry?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:49
Yes.

[Stacey Druss] 09:32:49
Can you… can you put… can you put Victoria's, um, thing on the email?

[Stacey Druss] 09:32:54
the, um… I don't know what it's called, the calidraw, or whatever.

[Gabriele G] 09:32:58
board.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:58
I will… I will add a link to the Excaladraw map

[Jerry Michalski] 09:33:03
to the email that I post when I posted this session online. That's a great idea.

[Stacey Druss] 09:33:06
Thank you. Thank you.

[Stacey Druss] 09:33:09
Okay. Bye, everybody.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:33:09
We'll do, Stacy, thank you.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:11
And Gabrielle, if you do… if you do write and post something, uh, post it also to the OGM mailing list so we can see it.

[Gabriele G] 09:33:18
I'm sorry, um, I don't…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:19
I think you said you were going to write or post something about your exploration. I invite you to share it with us on the OGM mailing list.

[Gabriele G] 09:33:27
Okay, I agree.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:33:27
once I put you on the list.
