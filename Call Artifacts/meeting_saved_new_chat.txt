	I totally agree. It’s been the most fascinating value I’ve gotten from my Playing Games model.
	
	My working theory is 1) there is a set of things that all games have, 2) that every interaction with another person is a game, and 3) therefore every interaction has these things. 
	
	So far, I've come up with five elements of a game:  Goal (purpose, point, reason for interacting), Rules (what's allowed or not, whether stated, implied, or customary), Voluntary (invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated), Uncertain (can't know the outcome for sure), and Improve (requires some skill).

	this is a curated answer by me and AI:
	
	Japanese culture values 探求心 (tankyūshina, focused desire to discover and understand deeply, rooted in long traditions of scholarship and the shokunin spirit, where traits like 精進 (shōjin, diligent effort), 向学心 (kōgakushin, desire to learn), and 好奇心 (kōkishin, curiosity) are admired.
	At the same time, this curiosity is expected to coexist with 謙虚 (kenkyo, humility), 和 (wa, social harmony), and 配慮 (hairyo, consideration for others), shaping it into a quieter, more situationally aware form of inquiry.
	For Americans accustomed to openly expressing personal curiosity, these values function as social cues that curiosity should be pursued in ways that avoid disruption, preserve group cohesion, and show respect for shared space.

	This conversation is so lovely. I need to run to another meeting but wanted to add here about somatic. Somatic experiencing can deepen curiosity by helping the body feel safe to explore rather than be passive, be reactive, turning tension and overwhelm into spaciousness for new perceptions. When we tune into the subtle signals of the body, curiosity becomes less an effort of the mind and more a natural opening to what is present, possible, and previously unseen.

	To me, curiosity extends beyond "noticing" and gets into "exploring"

	I feel like it's perhaps more, “Curiosity = Noticing things you didn’t know that you needed to know.”

	@John Warinner @Pete Kaminski  Interesting! I like the exploration addition. The exploratory circuits are essential to learning the things we need to know. 
	
	I’m thinking about the feeling of asking  “Why aren’t you curious about that?”.

	This is so interesting! Thank you fort this share! I came in this conversation because I am attending an online workshop on Visual thinking (where I met Victoria) and we had a 1h q&a session with the teacher and I felt mixed: I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because "I don't know wha to ask (first)", I have some trails but they were so vague. So I apreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question "good" to ask.
	
	This open for me the point: why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?

	@Stacey Druss  Thanks for noticing this relationship —> Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity? That’s something I will be pondering.

2025-11-13 09:29:03 From Pete Kaminski to Everyone:
	from John K.: I found that if you created a context in which there's a social reason for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the the benefit in terms of the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of (paraphrased after this point) realizing, “Oh—we actually discovered something we weren’t even looking for.” If you’d told them to look for it, they probably wouldn’t have. But because it happened inside this little game, they ended up uncovering something new and walked away with a different perspective.
	Doug Breitbart:👍🏻
