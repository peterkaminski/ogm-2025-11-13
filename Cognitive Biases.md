# Cognitive Biases

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment.

## Relevance to Curiosity

[[Alex Kladitis]]'s discussion of [[Belief Systems and Curiosity]] touches on several cognitive biases:

### Confirmation Bias
- Seeking information that confirms beliefs
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Interpreting ambiguous evidence as confirming

### Compartmentalization
- Holding contradictory beliefs without seeing conflict
- Not being curious about inconsistencies
- Separating information into mental silos

### In-Group Bias
- Favoring information from our group
- Dismissing information from "other side"
- Tribal thinking over truth-seeking

## The Universal Challenge

Alex's point:

> "We are all doing this. Every day, even in this call, we will do it."

Even highly curious people:
- Fall prey to cognitive biases
- Protect cherished beliefs
- Fail to question assumptions
- Miss alternative perspectives

## Curiosity as Antidote?

Can curiosity combat biases?
- [[Multi-Perspectival Humbleness]] helps
- [[Critical Thinking]] helps
- But biases are persistent and subtle

Or do biases limit curiosity?
- We're less curious about what threatens beliefs
- Biases shape what we notice
- Confirmation bias kills genuine inquiry

Probably both: bidirectional relationship.
