# Compartmentalization

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Compartmentalization is the mental process of keeping contradictory beliefs separate to avoid cognitive dissonance.

## Alex's Example

[[Alex Kladitis]] offered a vivid illustration:

> "We'll go to page one, and we'll read about some politician announcing a new this, that, and the other. And say how great the politician is, if we support them. And then we'll go to page 5, you know, page 5 of a newspaper. And there's an article of what shysters the politicians are. And we can compartmentalize the two and not cross-feed."

> "If he's the shyster over there, if that part is lying over there, what tells you that they tell the truth here?"

## How It Kills Curiosity

Compartmentalization prevents:
- **Connecting** contradictory information
- **Questioning** inconsistencies
- **Integrating** knowledge across domains
- **Pattern recognition** across contexts

If you keep beliefs in separate boxes:
- You're not curious about connections
- You don't ask "how does this fit with that?"
- You avoid uncomfortable synthesis
- You maintain comfortable contradictions

## The Universal Tendency

Alex: "I do it, and I'm sure everybody else does it."

Even highly curious people compartmentalize:
- Work beliefs vs personal beliefs
- One domain vs another
- Short-term vs long-term thinking
- What we know vs what we do

## Connection to DSRP

[[DSRP Theory]] emphasizes **Relationships**:
- Seeing connections between things
- Integration across systems
- Holistic understanding

Compartmentalization is the opposite:
- Keeping things separate
- Blocking connections
- Fragmented understanding

## Breaking Compartments

Would require:
- [[Multi-Perspectival Humbleness]] - viewing whole picture
- [[Systems Thinking]] - seeing interconnections
- Willingness to face contradictions
- Courage to integrate uncomfortable truths
