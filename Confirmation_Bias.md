# Confirmation Bias

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs.

## How It Works

- Seek out confirming evidence
- Ignore or dismiss contradictory evidence
- Interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting
- Remember hits, forget misses

## Connection to Curiosity

From [[Belief Systems and Curiosity]]:

Confirmation bias **mimics** curiosity:
- You're "curious" to learn more
- But only about things that confirm
- You stop being curious when evidence contradicts
- Not genuine curiosity but selective attention

## Alex's Challenge

[[Alex Kladitis]] essentially accused the group of confirmation bias:

> "I can find every single... at least one example where each one of you has made a statement, and I'm thinking, But why don't you look at it from this point of view?"

Even in a discussion **about** curiosity, we may:
- Seek perspectives that fit our views
- Ignore challenges to our thinking
- Confirm what we already believe about curiosity

## The Compartmentalization Example

Alex's newspaper example:
- Page 1: Politician announces great thing → confirms they're good
- Page 5: Same politician shown as corrupt → ignore or forget

We **selectively attend** based on what we want to believe.

## Breaking the Pattern

Possible remedies:
- [[Multi-Perspectival Humbleness]] - actively seek disconfirming views
- [[Critical Thinking]] - examine own reasoning
- [[5 Whys]] - dig deeper than surface confirmations
- Genuine [[Curiosity as Social Practice]] - ask those who disagree
