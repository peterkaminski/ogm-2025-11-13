# Critical Thinking

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Jerry Michalski]] proposed that critical thinking might be an alternative framing for the curiosity discussion.

## The Connection

Jerry suggested:

> "I would have called critical thinking. And I'm also realizing that we could have replaced the word curiosity with the phrase critical thinking in the invite to today's call, and probably would have gotten a similar showing."

## Adjacent or Identical?

[[Gil Friend]] responded: "adjacent"

This raised the question: **How exactly do curiosity and critical thinking relate?**

Possibilities:
- Curiosity = wanting to know
- Critical thinking = how you know
- Curiosity drives inquiry, critical thinking evaluates it
- Both are necessary but insufficient alone

## What Happened to Critical Thinking?

Jerry added to a list of losses:

> "What happened to listening? To discourse? To critical thinking? To civility?"

This suggested critical thinking, like curiosity, may be perceived as declining.

## Alex's Perspective

[[Alex Kladitis]]'s points about [[Belief Systems and Curiosity]] connect strongly to critical thinking:

> "We don't want to challenge our mental model and belief system."

Critical thinking requires:
- Examining assumptions
- Considering alternative explanations
- Evaluating evidence
- Questioning beliefs

All blocked by defensive belief systems.

## Scott's Uncertainty

[[Scott Moehring]] added:

> "Right after my thing. Scott's unsure."

Even within a curious group, the relationship between curiosity and critical thinking wasn't clear.

## Implications

If curiosity and critical thinking are:

**Adjacent** - They're related but distinct
- Need both for good inquiry
- Can have one without the other
- Different pedagogical approaches needed

**Nearly Identical** - They're different framings of the same thing
- "Curiosity" sounds more playful and open
- "Critical thinking" sounds more analytical and skeptical
- Different words appeal to different audiences

## Educational Context

Schools often claim to teach "critical thinking" but the conversation suggests:
- It may be taught poorly or not at all
- [[Education and Curiosity]] applies equally to critical thinking
- Both require practice in safe containers
- Both get killed by belief-protection
