# Curiosity and Care

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The deep connection between being curious and caring, rooted in etymology.

## The Link

From [[Etymology of Curiosity]]:

> "To be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

Curiosity = Care + Attention

Not detached inquiry but **caring engagement**.

## Implications

If curiosity requires care:
- [[Genuine vs Performative Curiosity]] - you can tell who cares
- [[Sense of Place]] - care for where you are
- [[Active Listening]] - care enough to remember
- Social curiosity - care about others

Without care:
- Questions become empty
- Curiosity becomes performance  
- Knowledge becomes extraction
- Connection fails
