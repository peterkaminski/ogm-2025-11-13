      <h1>Curiosity as Social Practice</h1>
<p>One of the most important insights from the call was <a class="wikilink" href="//Pete_Kaminski.html">Pete Kaminski</a>'s distinction between <strong>innate curiosity</strong> and <strong>learned social practices</strong> of curiosity.</p>
<h2>Pete's Core Insight</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some curiosity is definitely innate, but another thing that Gil's story made me realize, is some curiosity is a social practice."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Learning Social Curiosity</h2>
<h3>Pete's Personal Story</h3>
<p>Pete described himself as "kind of shy" and shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I learned from Johanne, my wife, to be able to be curious and have a conversation with somebody, even if maybe you don't care in the grander scheme of things, or you're shy, or whatever."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's just a rote thing, right? It's just human and polite to be sitting with somebody and to ask them, you know, how's your life? Do you have pets? Do you have friends? Where did you grow up? Those kinds of things. It's not hard to do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pete <strong>wasn't taught this</strong> by parents, peers, or school</li>
<li>He learned it <strong>quickly from Johanne</strong></li>
<li>It's a <strong>teachable skill</strong>, not just innate trait</li>
<li>It helps <strong>everybody</strong>, not just the person being asked</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Five Basic Questions</h3>
<p>Pete suggested there's a <strong>simple set of questions</strong> anyone can learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy. But, you know, there's a set of, like, 5 questions that even a man can learn, you know, ask this question, really care about the answer, and there's probably a follow-up question."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>How's your life?</li>
<li>Do you have pets?</li>
<li>Do you have friends?</li>
<li>Where did you grow up?</li>
<li>Where did you go to school?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Genuine vs Performative</h2>
<h3>Stacey's Important Caveat</h3>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Stacey_Druss.html">Stacey Druss</a> warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Curiosity when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying. As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pete agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Insincere curiosity is worse than just shutting up."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Path to Genuine Interest</h3>
<p>Pete's nuanced response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's not hard at all to learn to ask humbly and be genuinely interested in the answer. Where did you grow up? It's not... I can ask that question and not care about the answer, but it's not hard as a social practice for me to say, I really do care where you grew up."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the <strong>mechanical practice</strong> of asking</li>
<li>Ask with <strong>humility</strong> and openness</li>
<li>Allow <strong>genuine interest</strong> to develop</li>
<li>Accept if the other person <strong>doesn't reciprocate</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Gender Dimensions</h2>
<h3>Women's Work</h3>
<p>Pete shared Johanne's observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Men are acculturated to not be curious, especially about women, about lots of stuff, right? And so in a way, it was a kind of women's work, that she doesn't mind doing because it's not the worst thing that women have to do in this world."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"She felt like she was always the one who were like, you know, it's not that hard, guys. Just ask questions."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Power and Curiosity</h3>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Stacey_Druss.html">Stacey Druss</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reveals curiosity isn't neutral - <strong>who asks whom</strong> matters. Questions from those with power can feel like demands; questions from equals feel like connection.</p>
<h2>Etiquette as Codified Social Curiosity</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Gil_Friend.html">Gil Friend</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"@Pete Kaminski This used to be taught as 'etiquette'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditional etiquette included:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to make small talk</li>
<li>Appropriate questions in various settings</li>
<li>Turn-taking in conversation</li>
<li>How to show interest without prying</li>
</ul>
<p>The breakdown of etiquette education may explain some perceived decline in curiosity.</p>
<h2>The Participatory Game</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Pete_Kaminski.html">Pete Kaminski</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's a bit of a participatory game that is best played by both participants; it's okay to answer by redirecting to a different topic rather than one you don't want to talk about. Navigating that social practice may be something that people have to be helped to learn, but it's pretty easy to learn."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Both participants</strong> need to play</li>
<li><strong>Redirecting</strong> is acceptable</li>
<li>It's <strong>teachable</strong></li>
<li>It's <strong>easier than it seems</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scott's Playing Games Model</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Scott_Moehring.html">Scott Moehring</a> proposed that <strong>every interaction is a game</strong> with five elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Goal</strong> - purpose, point, reason for interacting</li>
<li><strong>Rules</strong> - what's allowed (stated, implied, or customary)</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary</strong> - invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated</li>
<li><strong>Uncertain</strong> - can't know the outcome for sure</li>
<li><strong>Improve</strong> - requires some skill</li>
</ol>
<p>This framework helps understand curiosity as a <strong>voluntary, rule-governed practice</strong> that both parties must consent to.</p>
<h2>Gil's Observations</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Gil_Friend.html">Gil Friend</a> noticed <strong>one-way conversations</strong> becoming more common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions. Which I found perplexing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His adaptation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've taken recently to doing something I've never done before, just like start to talk about things in the course of meeting someone new. I'll start to talk about what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I want to talk about, what I would have wanted to be asked about."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests some people <strong>haven't learned the reciprocal pattern</strong> of social curiosity.</p>
<h2>Where Social Curiosity Should Be Learned</h2>
<p>Pete suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somewhere in our world, it ought to be and end up that you get taught by your peers, or your school, or your parents, or somebody. You know, here's some things that you can do to enact curiosity, even if you're not particularly interested, just enact it as a social practice because it helps everybody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question: <strong>Who teaches this now?</strong> If not parents, schools, or peers, where do people learn?</p>
<h2>Benefits of Social Curiosity</h2>
<p>Even when not deeply felt, enacted curiosity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps people <strong>feel good</strong> when you talk about them</li>
<li>Helps you <strong>learn stuff</strong> you wouldn't have known otherwise</li>
<li>Creates <strong>connection</strong> across differences</li>
<li>Makes time pass pleasantly (in carriages, airplanes, waiting rooms)</li>
<li>Builds <strong>social cohesion</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Modern Challenges</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//Scott_Moehring.html">Scott Moehring</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"@Pete Kaminski Asking about people — who they are, what they are into, who they are in relationship with — is that now considered intrusive and rude? Are we now supposed to let people reveal on their own?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This raises whether <strong>norms are shifting</strong> about what questions are appropriate.</p>
<h2>The Listening Component</h2>
<p><a class="wikilink" href="//LP1_(Louise).html">LP1 (Louise)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And remember the answer!!!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social curiosity requires not just <strong>asking</strong> but <strong>remembering</strong> and <strong>following up</strong> - genuine care over time.</p>
<h2>Unanswered Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do we <strong>teach social curiosity</strong> when traditional etiquette is no longer widely taught?</li>
<li>Can we distinguish between <strong>appropriate reserve</strong> and <strong>failure to learn social practices</strong>?</li>
<li>How do we navigate <strong>cultural differences</strong> in social curiosity norms?</li>
<li>What's the relationship between <strong>shyness</strong> and social curiosity skills?</li>
</ul>
