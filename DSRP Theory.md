# DSRP Theory

**DSRP** is a systems thinking framework that [[Scott Moehring]] called **"the most important and practical thing I've ever learned."**

## What DSRP Stands For

- **D**istinctions - identifying what is and what isn't
- **S**ystems - understanding parts and wholes
- **R**elationships - seeing connections between things
- **P**erspectives - recognizing different viewpoints

## Relevance to Curiosity

Scott explained:

> "I think it is the organization and reorganization of information that is the primary space of curiosity."

This suggests **curiosity is fundamentally about making and remaking patterns** - distinguishing, connecting, relating, and shifting perspectives.
