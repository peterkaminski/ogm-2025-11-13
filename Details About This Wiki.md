## Navigation

### Wiki Links

All pages use `[[Double Square Bracket Links]]` to connect concepts. Clicking any link takes you to that page.

### Finding Content

Three main pathways:

1. **Start at README.md** - High-level overview with links to major sections
2. **Browse [[Concept Index]]** - Complete categorized listing
3. **Follow links** - Each page links to related content

### Breadcrumb Trail

The interconnected links create natural paths through the content. You can:
- Start with a participant and see all topics they discussed
- Start with a topic and see who contributed
- Follow concept links to explore related ideas

## Conventions

### Orphan Pages

Some pages begin with:

> **Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

These "orphan pages" cover concepts referenced but not fully explored. They provide:
- Brief explanations of the concept
- Context for why it was mentioned
- Links to where it connected to the discussion

### Attribution

Quotes are attributed to participants by name. When someone relayed another's point (like Pete sharing John Kelly's insights when John was on the phone), both are credited.

### Time References

The call took place November 13, 2025. Chat logs include timestamps. The wiki synthesizes chronological content into thematic organization.

## Content Philosophy

### Comprehensive Coverage
We aimed to capture:
- All participants, even brief contributors
- All substantive topics raised
- Links and resources shared
- The nuance and complexity of the conversation

### Respect for Complexity
The wiki avoids:
- Oversimplifying disagreements
- Forcing consensus where none existed
- Picking winners in debates
- Flattening multidimensional discussions

### Multiple Entry Points
Different users can:
- Focus on specific people
- Follow specific themes
- Explore tools and frameworks
- Browse the full concept index

## Visual Artifacts

The call included a collaborative [[Excalidraw]] board:
- Link: https://excalidraw.com/#room=f2fc1ed4dad8ce25b385,JsA211Hzb_1dUSb-gwYctQ
- Snapshot: `Call Artifacts/excalidraw-snapshot-2025-11-13.png`

The visual board captured non-linear connections and collective sense-making in real-time.
