## Article Shared

[[Pete Kaminski]] shared Doc's perspective on curiosity:

> "I like what Doc said on the list: I can't shake the sense that incuriosity is not new. Moreover, I think it sometimes persisted for thousands of years in cultures far less advanced than ours."

## Key Argument

Doc's 2011 article (referenced 14 years before this call) argued that:
- **Incuriosity is not new** to modern times
- It has **persisted for millennia** in various cultures
- The perception of declining curiosity may be **selective memory**

This provided historical perspective challenging the "kids these days" narrative about declining curiosity.

## Pete's Caveat

> "(notwithstanding unnecessary things we do nowadays to kill curiosity, that's true too)"

Pete acknowledged that while Doc's long-view is important, modern society does create specific new obstacles to curiosity.

## Relevance to Discussion

Doc's perspective supported:
- [[Kevin Jones]]'s and [[Pete Kaminski]]'s skepticism about curiosity declining
- The idea that we may romanticize the past
- Recognition that curiosity has always faced obstacles
