# Doug Breitbart

**Role:** Systems thinking contributor

## Contributions to the Discussion

Doug participated primarily through resource sharing and supporting others' contributions.

### DSRP Theory Support

When [[Kevin Jones]] asked "What is DSRP?", Doug provided the resource:

> [DSRP Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSRP)

This supported [[Scott Moehring]]'s discussion of [[DSRP Theory]] as a framework for understanding how curiosity relates to organizing and reorganizing information.

### Connection as the Underlying Ingredient

From the transcript, Doug shared a profound insight about what underlies curiosity:

> "I think curiosity... the underlying ingredient is connection. And I think that's what we're... that's what we're talking about here, is connecting with things, connecting with people, connecting with ideas."

This reframes curiosity not as an isolated cognitive process but as **fundamentally relational**:
- Curiosity as **connecting** with things, people, ideas
- **Connection** as the deeper substrate beneath questions
- Curiosity as a **relational practice**, not just information-seeking

### His Hypersocial Son

Doug shared a personal story about his son that illuminated the connection-curiosity link:

> "My son is hypersocial. He's always been that way since he was a little kid. And he's curious about people. He wants to know everything about everybody."

> "But he's not particularly curious about... you know, academic subjects or... He's curious about people and relationships."

This challenged conventional definitions of curiosity:
- **Hypersocial curiosity** is a legitimate form of curiosity
- Being curious about **people and relationships** counts
- Not all curiosity is academic or intellectual
- **Social connection** can be the primary curiosity driver

### Appreciation for Tools

> "Thanks for this, Victoria. 🙏🏻" (responding to [[Victoria (Spain)]]'s share of the [[Question Formulation Technique]])

Doug showed appreciation for practical tools that cultivate curiosity.
