# Embodied Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Curiosity that arises from and is expressed through the body, not just the mind.

## From Eve Blossom

[[Eve Blossom]]'s [[Somatic Experiencing]] approach emphasizes:

> "When we tune into the subtle signals of the body, curiosity becomes less an effort of the mind and more a natural opening to what is present, possible, and previously unseen."

Bodily curiosity:
- Feels rather than thinks
- Senses rather than analyzes
- Opens rather than forces
- Emerges from spaciousness

## Connection to Place

[[Sense of Place]] is inherently embodied:
- Your body is always somewhere
- Physical relationship to environment
- Grounded inquiry
