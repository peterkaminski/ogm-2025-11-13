# Essential Knowledge

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

What knowledge and skills remain essential as technology changes?

## Scott's Question

[[Scott Moehring]]:

> "Is it important to know how to change a flat tire, if you can get it done through other means? We might feel like that is ridiculous that they wouldn't know how to do that, but is it still 'essential knowledge' in a modern world?"

## The Challenge

What seems essential changes:
- Slide rules → calculators → symbolic math software
- Map reading → GPS
- Spelling → spell-check
- Writing → AI assistance

Each generation faces: What should we teach?

## For Education

[[Education and Curiosity]] must grapple with:
- Teaching specific skills vs teaching adaptability
- Current tools vs timeless principles
- What will remain valuable
- How to prepare for unknown futures

## Victoria's Point

[[Victoria (Spain)]]:

> "Students can't be expected to put work on work they don't believe in. That's precisely what AIs are for."

If students sense work won't be essential, they're **rationally incurious** about it.

## Meta-Skills

Perhaps essential knowledge is:
- How to learn
- How to be curious
- How to adapt
- How to ask questions ([[Question Formulation Technique]])
- How to think critically
