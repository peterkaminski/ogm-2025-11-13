# Etiquette

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Gil Friend]] noted that social curiosity practices used to be taught as etiquette.

## Gil's Observation

> "@Pete Kaminski This used to be taught as 'etiquette'"

[[Pete Kaminski]] responded:

> "Navigating that social practice may be something that people have to be helped to learn, but it's pretty easy to learn."

## What Etiquette Included

Traditional etiquette codified:
- How to make small talk
- Appropriate questions in various settings
- Turn-taking in conversation
- Showing interest without prying
- Reciprocal inquiry
- Remembering and following up

## The Breakdown

What happened to etiquette education?
- Less formal teaching by parents
- Schools don't teach it
- Class-based nature made it seem elitist
- Cultural diversity complicated shared norms
- Informal norms replaced formal rules

## Connection to Curiosity

Etiquette provided:
- **Scaffolding** for social curiosity
- **Shared expectations** about questions
- **Permission** to ask (and decline to answer)
- **Social safety** through predictable patterns

Without it:
- People may not know **how** to express curiosity
- Unclear what's **appropriate** to ask
- Fear of **getting it wrong**
- No shared language for navigation

## Cultural Dimensions

[[Gil Friend]] noted:

> "All games have rules. Cultures/subcultures/social classes have norms."

Etiquette varied by:
- Social class
- Region
- Culture
- Context

Loss of shared etiquette might mean:
- Increased [[Cross-Cultural Communication]] challenges
- More reliance on implicit rather than explicit norms
- Greater potential for misunderstanding

## Can We Rebuild?

If etiquette enabled [[Curiosity as Social Practice]]:
- Do we need new, inclusive etiquette?
- How do we teach social curiosity practices?
- Can we have shared norms without class/cultural dominance?
- What replaces traditional etiquette?
