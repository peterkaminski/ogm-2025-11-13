# Eve Blossom

**Role:** Somatic experiencing practitioner

## Contributions to the Discussion

Eve brought a unique embodied perspective, emphasizing the somatic and place-based dimensions of curiosity.

### Curiosity and Sense of Place

[[Jerry Michalski]] captured Eve's contribution:

> "Eve: curiosity + sense of place, to keep it alive"

Eve connected curiosity to our **physical relationship with the world** and specific locations, suggesting that rootedness in place can sustain and deepen curiosity.

### Somatic Experiencing

Eve's powerful statement on the body's role in curiosity:

> "Somatic experiencing can deepen curiosity by helping the body feel safe to explore rather than be passive, be reactive, turning tension and overwhelm into spaciousness for new perceptions. When we tune into the subtle signals of the body, curiosity becomes less an effort of the mind and more a natural opening to what is present, possible, and previously unseen."

### Key Insights

- Curiosity requires **feeling safe** in the body
- The body can be either passive/reactive OR actively exploring
- **Tension and overwhelm** can be transformed into **spaciousness**
- Somatic awareness creates **natural openings** rather than forced inquiry
- Curiosity is about noticing "what is **present, possible, and previously unseen**"

### Teaching and Learning

[[Gil Friend]] quoted Eve:

> "I love 'be a teacher or help people learn'!"

This suggests Eve distinguishes between directive teaching and facilitative learning, with the latter supporting curiosity.
