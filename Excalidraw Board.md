## How the Board Was Used

The Excalidraw board served as a dynamic visual thinking space throughout the call:

### Opening Invitation

[[Jerry Michalski]] opened the call by inviting everyone:

> "Please enter the whiteboard https://excalidraw.com/#room=..."

### Active Collaboration

Participants actively contributed concepts and connections:

**[[Victoria (Spain)]]** organized the board with sections like:
- "What is curiosity for?" section addressing purpose and meaning

**[[Scott Moehring]]** added conceptual frameworks:
> "@Alex - I added 'multi-perspectival humbleness' to the whiteboard. 🙂"

**[[Victoria (Spain)]]** captured others' contributions:
> "@Eve Blossom I added your sense of place to the whiteboard. You can elaborate there if you want"

### Visual Thinking Practice

The board exemplified:
- **Real-time collaborative thinking** - Multiple people building ideas together
- **Visual synthesis** - Spatial organization of concepts and relationships
- **Multimodal documentation** - Complementing verbal discussion with visual mapping
- **Invitation to participate** - Low-barrier way for quieter participants to contribute
