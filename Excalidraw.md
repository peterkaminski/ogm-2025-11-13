## Victoria's Facilitation

> "And just to make everyone comfortable, I have a copy of this State of the Board. So, if everything is messed… It doesn't matter."

This created psychological safety for experimentation.

## Key Additions

Throughout the call, participants added:
- [[Gil Friend]] - etymology of curiosity connecting to care
- [[Scott Moehring]] - "multi-perspectival humbleness"
- [[Eve Blossom]] - sense of place (added by Victoria on Eve's behalf)
- Various concepts, questions, and connections

## Victoria's Visual Thinking Emphasis

> "Let's use for exploring rather than answering. Let's open as many questions as possible. So if instead of saying, 'education closes curiosity,' we state it as a question: 'Does education close?' Then we will have more things to work with."

This embodied the principle of **keeping inquiry open**.

## Visual Thinking Connection

[[Gabriele G]] met Victoria through a visual thinking workshop, suggesting the broader community around these practices.

## Benefits for Curiosity

The collaborative whiteboard:
- Enables **non-linear thinking**
- Shows **connections** visually
- Allows **simultaneous contribution**
- Creates **shared artifact** of collective thinking
- Supports **multiple perspectives** literally on same canvas
