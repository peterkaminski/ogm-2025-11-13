Tools, methodologies, and frameworks for understanding and cultivating curiosity that emerged during the call.

## 🎯 Question-Generation Tools

### [[Question Formulation Technique]]
**Victoria's passionate recommendation from the [[Right Question Institute]]**

A structured methodology for teaching people how to formulate good questions. Victoria advocated strongly for this, sharing a transformation story from her Greek mythology seminar where nobody asked questions until she introduced QFT.

**The Four Rules:**
1. Ask as many questions as you can
2. Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss
3. Write down every question exactly as stated
4. Change any statements into questions

**Complete Process:** Generate questions → Prioritize questions → Decide what to do with top 3

**Victoria's diagnosis:** "We were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions."

**Use when:** Groups need to generate questions, overcome "question poverty," or shift from answers to inquiry.

### [[5 Whys]]
**Root cause questioning from lean manufacturing**

Keep asking "why" five times in succession to move from symptoms to systemic issues. John Kelly added important nuance: create social containers for participation first, and consider using "how" instead of "why" for less threatening exploration.

**John's hierarchy:** Do "what" and "how" before jumping to "why"
- **"What?"** - Establish what is actually happening
- **"How?"** - Understand mechanisms (more neutral)
- **"Why?"** - Explore motivations (assumes human agency, can feel accusatory)

**Use when:** Investigating root causes, especially in systems thinking or problem-solving contexts.

## 🧩 Conceptual Frameworks

### [[DSRP Theory]]
**Scott's "most important and practical thing I've ever learned"**

Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives - a framework for organizing and reorganizing information. Scott: "I think it is the organization and reorganization of information that is the primary space of curiosity."

**Four elements:**
- **Distinctions** - What is this vs what is it not?
- **Systems** - Part/whole relationships
- **Relationships** - Connections between things
- **Perspectives** - Different viewpoints

**Use when:** Analyzing complex systems, developing critical thinking, teaching information organization.

### [[Playing Games Model]]
**Scott's framework: every interaction is a game**

**Five universal elements:**
1. **Goal** - Purpose, point, reason for interacting
2. **Rules** - What's allowed or not (stated, implied, or customary)
3. **Voluntary** - Invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated
4. **Uncertain** - Can't know the outcome for sure
5. **Improve** - Requires some skill

Scott: "It's been the most fascinating value I've gotten from my Playing Games model."

**Applied to curiosity:** Conversations are games with goals, rules, voluntary participation, uncertainty, and skill requirements.

**Use when:** Analyzing social interactions, understanding why conversations succeed or fail, designing better dialogue spaces.

### [[Big Five Personality Traits]]
**Scott's entry point for understanding curiosity**

The statistically verified personality model where **Openness** is one of five dimensions. Openness includes curiosity, creativity, interest in intellectual pursuits, and being open to new experiences.

**Key insight:** "Neither end of the spectrum is evolutionarily better, which is why we have the spectrum. Sometimes you need to be less open."

**Use when:** Understanding individual differences in curiosity, avoiding pathologizing low curiosity, recognizing diversity of cognitive styles.

## 🗣️ Classical Methods

### [[Socratic Method]]
**Teaching through questioning**

The ancient practice of teaching through questions rather than answers. Several participants mentioned parents who used this: "What do you think?" instead of telling.

**Connection to curiosity:** Models curiosity as a practice, empowers learners to think for themselves, develops question-asking skills.

**Use when:** Teaching, facilitating learning, developing critical thinking.

### [[Reflective Questioning]]
**Judith and Stacey's parenting experience**

Asking "What do you think?" instead of providing answers. Creates space for children to develop their own curiosity and reasoning.

**Use when:** Parenting, mentoring, coaching, any context where you want to develop agency rather than dependence.

## 🛠️ Practical Tools

### [[Excalidraw]]
**The collaborative whiteboard used during the call**

Open-source visual collaboration tool. Victoria and Jerry used it to create real-time visual maps of concepts and connections during the conversation.

**See:** [[Excalidraw Board]] for the actual board created during the call.

**Use when:** Visual thinking, collaborative synthesis, spatial organization of ideas, multimodal documentation.

### [[Natural Logic]]
**Gil's consultancy methodology**

Gil Friend's approach to sustainability consulting. Mentioned in context of training engineers who lacked "map of distinctions" to ask follow-up questions.

**Use when:** Sustainability work, systems analysis, organizational consulting.
