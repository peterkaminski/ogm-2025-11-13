# Generational Perspectives

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The conversation touched on how different generations experience and express curiosity.

## The "Kids These Days" Question

The call began with concerns about younger generations:

[[Jerry Michalski]]:
> "Hey, uh, kids in school seem incurious, things like that are happening. Like, are we losing curiosity?"

[[Victoria (Spain)]]'s son (age 30, university instructor) reported:
> "How uncurious and unengaged his university students are getting every year."

## Pushback on Generational Decline

[[Kevin Jones]] immediately challenged this:
> "I am not seeing a decline"

[[Doc Searls]]'s 2011 article (shared by [[Pete Kaminski]]) argued:
> "I can't shake the sense that incuriosity is not new. Moreover, I think it sometimes persisted for thousands of years in cultures far less advanced than ours."

This suggests the "decline" narrative may be **perennial**, not unique to our time.

## Gil's Counter-Evidence

[[Gil Friend]]'s story about the 55-year-old friend who asked no questions challenged the assumption that incuriosity is generational:

> "It echoes the question about curiosity. It challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people, because she's, you know, not younger."

## What's Different for Young People Today

[[LP1 (Louise)]]:
> "Absolutely, it's a very different world if you're a teenager today. I can't imagine what it is like for them."

> "They're involved in another world online."

Different context, not lesser curiosity:
- Parallel online/offline worlds
- Different information landscapes
- Different social pressures
- Different future prospects

## The BS Meter Hypothesis

[[Scott Moehring]] and [[Kevin Jones]] suggested younger people aren't less curious but more discerning:

> "Could it be that their BS meter is more finely tuned? That they realize that most of the things that they are being asked to be curious about are being decided by other people?"

Kevin: "Exactly. From boomers and the like."

Perhaps apparent incuriosity is actually:
- Appropriate skepticism
- Selective attention
- Rejection of imposed priorities
- Different values

## The No Future Question

[[Victoria (Spain)]]:
> "Can you be curious when everyone says there is no future?"

Younger generations face:
- Climate crisis
- Economic uncertainty
- Political instability
- Generational pessimism

How does this shape curiosity?

## Cross-Generational Understanding

[[Pete Kaminski]]'s learning social curiosity from Joanne shows:
- Curiosity practices can be learned across generations
- Different generations have different baseline skills
- Teaching/learning can flow both directions
