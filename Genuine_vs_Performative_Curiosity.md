# Genuine vs Performative Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Stacey Druss]] made an important distinction between curiosity that is genuine and curiosity that is performative or insincere.

## Stacey's Insight

> "Curiosity when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying."

> "As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."

> "When it's genuine, it's wonderful."

## What Makes Curiosity Performative?

Performative curiosity:
- Asks questions without really caring about answers
- Is done because it's "supposed to"
- Feels like going through motions
- Carries hidden agendas
- Serves the asker, not connection

## How Performative Curiosity Feels

To the person being asked:
- Like **prying** (as [[Jerry Michalski]] noted)
- Like having to **justify** yourself
- Like **interrogation** rather than conversation
- Like **emotional labor** you're being asked to do
- **Annoying** and inauthentic

## What Makes Curiosity Genuine?

[[Pete Kaminski]]'s response:

> "It's not hard at all to learn to ask humbly and be genuinely interested in the answer."

Genuine curiosity:
- Comes from real interest
- Is asked with **humility**
- Truly values the answer
- Serves **connection**
- Respects the person's choice to answer or not

## The Path from Performance to Genuine

Pete suggested a progression:

1. **Learn the practice** - rote questions
2. **Ask with humility** - even if not deeply interested
3. **Become genuinely interested** - "I really do care where you grew up"

So performative practice can **become** genuine over time.

## The Power Dimension

Stacey's point about feeling disempowered reveals:

**Who asks matters.** Questions from:
- **Those with power** → can feel demanding, invasive
- **Equals** → can feel connecting, genuine
- **Those seeking to help** → can feel patronizing

Same question, different power context, different meaning.

## Etymology Connection

From [[Etymology of Curiosity]]:

> "To be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

**Genuine curiosity = genuine care**
**Performative curiosity = fake care**

And we can tell the difference.

## Somatic Knowing

[[Eve Blossom]]'s [[Somatic Experiencing]] perspective suggests:

We know in our bodies when curiosity is genuine:
- Genuine feels **spacious**
- Performative feels **constricting**
- Our nervous systems read authenticity

## When Stacey Sets Boundaries

> "I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do. I probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you."

This is **honest** - refusing to perform curiosity she doesn't feel. Pete affirmed:

> "Well, you ask even better questions, Stacey."

Better to ask fewer, genuine questions than many performative ones.

## Implications for Practice

If we're teaching [[Curiosity as Social Practice]]:
- Start with **practice** (it's learnable)
- Move toward **genuine interest** (it can be cultivated)
- Respect **authentic boundaries** (don't force it)
- Be aware of **power dynamics** (context matters)
- Allow **honesty** (better to say "I don't know what to ask")
