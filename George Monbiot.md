# George Monbiot

**Note:** This person was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Writer, environmental activist, and commentator known for work on climate change, rewilding, and narrative change.

## Quote Shared

[[Stacey Druss]] referenced Monbiot:

> "George Monbiot, where he says, where we don't have a story, we make up one."

## Application

Stacey used this to frame her response to [[Gil Friend]]'s stories about people who don't ask questions:

> "The story that I made up in my mind, is that sometimes people that are either younger or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age..."

## Relevance to Curiosity

The quote illuminates how we:
- Fill **gaps in understanding** with narratives
- Make **assumptions** about others' behavior
- Create **explanatory stories** that may or may not be accurate

This connects to the discussion about whether apparent incuriosity is:
- Actual lack of curiosity
- Different expression of curiosity
- Our **story** about what we observe rather than the reality
