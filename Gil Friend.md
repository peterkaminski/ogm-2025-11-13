## Contributions to the Discussion

Gil brought rich personal observations and stories about experiencing what appears to be declining curiosity, particularly in one-on-one interactions.

### Key Observations and Stories

#### The Networking Phenomenon

Gil shared striking observations about **one-way conversations** at networking events:

> "I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions. Which I found perplexing."

He noted he's had to adapt by **talking about his own interests unprompted**, rather than waiting to be asked.

#### The Three-Hour Visit

Gil shared a particularly poignant story about a three-hour visit with a longtime friend (known since age 12, now 55) who **didn't ask a single question** about Gil or his wife Jane, despite Jane's ongoing major health issues.

> "I became increasingly uncomfortable. I was really baffled. I didn't figure out what was weird until afterwards."

This story challenged his assumption that lack of curiosity was primarily a generational phenomenon.

#### The Site Assessment Story

From his work at [[Natural Logic]], Gil recounted training a junior engineer who **failed to gather critical information** during an independent site assessment. The engineer simply **hadn't thought to ask** obvious follow-up questions, revealing how different his "map of distinctions" was.

### Etymology and Deeper Meanings

Gil introduced the **etymology of curiosity**, sharing that it relates to **care** (Latin: cura):

> "Curiosity didn't begin as a quest for knowledge but as an act of care. Over time, we've separated inquiry from emotion, treating curiosity as a mental exercise. But its origins reveal a deeper truth: to be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

### Cultural and Social Dimensions

- Suggested that discomfort in conversations might stem from **"interacting across different assumption sets"**
- Noted: **"All games have rules. Cultures/subcultures/social classes have norms."**
- Asked: **"Possible more general case than 'kids these days': someone different (generation, gender, geography, etc etc…)?"**

### Personal Philosophy

> "I'm energized when someone says 'I've never thought of that this way before.' In fact it's been a central metric in my work for decades."

## Medical Curiosity

Gil has been using AI extensively to work with his medical team more effectively, using **"very careful training and prompting"** to enhance his understanding and collaboration with healthcare providers.
