# How vs Why Questions

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[John Kelly]] observed that "how" questions may be more neutral and less threatening than "why" questions.

## John's Insight

> "How is a more neutral version of why"

## The Difference

**"Why" questions** can feel:
- Accusatory ("Why did you do that?")
- Demanding justification
- Judgmental
- Personal

**"How" questions** tend to feel:
- Curious about process
- Interested in mechanism
- Neutral
- Exploratory

## Examples

- "Why are you late?" → accusatory
- "How did you get here?" → interested

- "Why don't you agree?" → defensive
- "How do you see it?" → curious

## For Curious Practice

Using "how" instead of "why" might:
- Lower defenses
- Enable genuine answers
- Feel less threatening
- Get better information
