# Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Judith Benham]] introduced this framework for understanding curiosity's sources.

## Judith's Framework

> "Curiosity, per se, is complex. Intrinsic vs extrinsic…situation, knowledge, experiences,. Perhaps worth addl in depth discussion."

## Intrinsic Curiosity

Arising from **internal drives**:
- Inherent interest in a topic
- Love of learning for its own sake
- Personal passion or fascination
- Internal motivation to understand

Examples:
- [[Pete Kaminski]] exploring AI with "crazy stuff" because he was curious
- Children asking endless "why" questions
- [[Gil Friend]] being an "etymology geek"

## Extrinsic Curiosity

Sparked by **external factors**:
- Specific situations demanding inquiry
- Environmental stimuli
- Social contexts
- Practical problems needing solutions
- Others' questions or interests

Examples:
- [[Gil Friend]]'s engineer needing to gather information for work
- [[Pete Kaminski]] learning social curiosity to navigate social situations
- Students pursuing topics required by curriculum

## The Interaction

Judith's formulation suggests curiosity arises from interaction of:
- **Intrinsic** drives
- **Extrinsic** situations
- Existing **knowledge**
- Past **experiences**

Not either/or but a complex mix.

## Implications

### For Education

[[Education and Curiosity]] needs to:
- Tap intrinsic motivation where it exists
- Create extrinsic conditions that spark curiosity
- Help students discover intrinsic interests
- Avoid killing intrinsic curiosity with poor extrinsic motivators (grades, tests)

### For Social Practice

[[Curiosity as Social Practice]] can:
- Start extrinsically (social norms)
- Develop into intrinsic interest
- [[Pete Kaminski]]: "I really do care where you grew up"
- Practice becomes genuine

### For Individual Differences

[[Big Five Personality Traits]] suggests:
- Some people are intrinsically higher in curiosity (Openness)
- But even they need supportive extrinsic conditions
- Both intrinsic and extrinsic matter

## Judith's Call for Deeper Discussion

> "Perhaps worth addl in depth discussion."

Open questions:
- How do intrinsic and extrinsic curiosity interact?
- Can extrinsic spark intrinsic, or does it crowd it out?
- How do we cultivate intrinsic curiosity?
- What extrinsic conditions best support curiosity?
