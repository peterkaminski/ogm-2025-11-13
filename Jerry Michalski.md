# Jerry Michalski

**Role:** Host and facilitator of the OGM curiosity call

## Contributions to the Discussion

Jerry served as the primary facilitator, guiding the conversation and introducing the central premise: Are we losing curiosity, particularly among younger generations and recent graduates?

### Key Points Raised

- Observed that recent graduates seem **incurious** when entering the workplace
- Questioned whether education is **"stamping out inquisitiveness"** through a focus on cramming rather than learning
- Connected curiosity to **critical thinking**, noting they could be adjacent topics
- Raised the issue of **identity and self-preservation** in the context of curiosity
- Asked whether people are now **afraid to take a stand** due to poor public discourse, fear of being canceled, or trolled

### Notable Quotes

> "I think Einstein said: It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education."

> "what happened to listening? to discourse? to critical thinking? to civility?"

> "maybe we want to leave less of a trace in the world, because its memory is long and its anger unpredictable?"
