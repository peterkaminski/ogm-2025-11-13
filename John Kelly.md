# John Kelly

**Role:** Participant with medical/hyperbaric expertise

## Contributions to the Discussion

John participated actively though had to manage competing commitments during the call.

### Participation Notes

> "Have to leave for appointment. Will come back on phone in a minutes"

John juggled the call with other obligations, showing commitment to the conversation despite constraints.

### On "How" vs "Why"

Pete Kaminski captured John's insight:

> "from John K.: how is a more neutral version of why"

This subtle but important point suggests that **"how" questions** may be less threatening or loaded than **"why" questions**, potentially eliciting more openness in conversations.

### Social Context for Inquiry

Pete Kaminski paraphrased John's contribution on creating safe spaces for curiosity:

> "from John K.: I found that if you created a context in which there's a social reason for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the benefit in terms of the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of realizing, 'Oh—we actually discovered something we weren't even looking for.' If you'd told them to look for it, they probably wouldn't have. But because it happened inside this little game, they ended up uncovering something new and walked away with a different perspective."

### Key Insights

- **Social reasons** can motivate participation in inquiry even when direct curiosity isn't present
- **Indirect discovery** through structured activities (like games) can bypass resistance
- People discover value **retroactively** rather than being told about it upfront
- Creating **safe containers** for exploration matters more than demanding curiosity
