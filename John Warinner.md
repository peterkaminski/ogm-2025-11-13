# John Warinner

**Role:** Deep thinker on the nature of curiosity and exploration

## Contributions to the Discussion

John helped refine the group's understanding of what curiosity actually involves.

### Curiosity as Exploration, Not Just Noticing

When [[Scott Moehring]] proposed "Curiosity = Noticing things you didn't have to notice," John responded:

> "To me, curiosity extends beyond 'noticing' and gets into 'exploring'"

This crucial distinction added **active investigation** to the definition, moving beyond passive observation.

### What Are You Curious About?

John posed a powerful reframing question:

> "If you are not curious about THIS... what are you curious about... and why do you care about THAT?"

This shifts from judging someone's lack of curiosity to **understanding what actually captures their attention** and why.

### Etymology Connection

> "The etymology connects back to 'care' and 'attention to detail'"

John reinforced [[Gil Friend]]'s point about the deep connection between curiosity and caring.

### Active Engagement

John showed appreciation for others' insights, particularly [[Scott Moehring]]'s exploration of the relationship between noticing and curiosity (❤️ reaction).

### Encouraging Participation
