# Judith Benham

**Role:** Former chemist at [[3M]], first woman hired as chemist there (according to [[Jerry Michalski]])

## Contributions to the Discussion

Judith brought scientific rigor and personal experience to the conversation about curiosity.

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Curiosity

Judith introduced an important distinction:

> "Curiosity, per se, is complex. Intrinsic vs extrinsic…situation, knowledge, experiences,. Perhaps worth addl in depth discussion."

This framework suggests that curiosity arises from both:
- **Intrinsic** sources - internal drives and interests
- **Extrinsic** sources - external situations, stimuli, and contexts

### Mother's Teaching Method

Judith shared a powerful personal story about how her mother cultivated curiosity:

> "As a child, whenever I asked a question, my mom would reply 'what do you think?', which led to expansive discussion."

This approach:
- Reflects the question back to the child
- Values the child's thinking
- Creates space for **expansive discussion** rather than simple answers
- Builds **metacognitive skills**

[[Victoria (Spain)]] responded: "My son hated that approach at first 😂"

[[Stacey Druss]] shared: "My dad did the same for me."

[[Gil Friend]] added: "Mine too"

This suggests a **powerful parenting practice** for cultivating curiosity, even if children initially resist it.

### Active Participation

[[Kevin Jones]] noted: "@Judith Benham seeing your thumb a lot" - indicating Judith actively engaged with reactions throughout the call.
