# Kevin Jones

**Role:** Impact investment pioneer, social entrepreneur

## Contributions to the Discussion

Kevin offered a contrarian voice early in the conversation, challenging the premise of declining curiosity.

### Core Position

> "I am not seeing a decline"

> "I completely disagree" (with the premise that curiosity is diminishing)

This challenge helped broaden the conversation beyond simple decline narratives.

### On BS Meters and Younger Generations

Kevin strongly supported [[Scott Moehring]]'s hypothesis about younger people's finely-tuned skepticism:

> "@Scott: Exactly" (in response to the BS meter being more finely tuned)

> "From boomers and the like" (clarifying whose BS young people can detect)

### On the Nature of Need and Curiosity

Kevin challenged Scott's definition of curiosity:

> "I am curious about things I need to know first"

> "I do not think so" (when asked if needing to know something makes motivation different from curiosity)

This led to an interesting exchange about what "need" means in the context of curiosity.

### Personal Interactions

- Warmly greeted [[Eve Blossom]]: "Hi @Eve Blossom" 😃
- Offered to connect with Eve: "w send email would love to talk to you about."

### Climate Science Context

Pete Kaminski shared on Kevin's behalf information about [[Benjamin D. Santer]], suggesting Kevin has deep knowledge of climate science history and the IPCC process.

### Cultural Observations

Kevin contributed observations about privacy and cultural norms:

> "Got it" (acknowledging [[Victoria (Spain)]]'s point about privacy norms in Catalonia)

### Judith's Contributions

> "@Judith Benham seeing your thumb a lot" (acknowledging Judith's active engagement)
