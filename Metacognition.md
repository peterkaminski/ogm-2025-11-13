# Metacognition

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Thinking about thinking; awareness of one's own thought processes.

## Developed Through Reflective Questioning

[[Judith Benham]]'s mother's approach:

> "What do you think?"

This develops metacognition:
- Awareness of own reasoning
- Examining own thought process
- Evaluating own understanding
- Recognizing knowledge gaps

## Connection to Curiosity

Metacognition enables:
- Knowing what you don't know
- Identifying good questions
- Evaluating your own answers
- Recognizing biases and assumptions

[[Gabriele G]]'s struggle with "anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom" might reflect need for metacognitive skills around question formulation.
