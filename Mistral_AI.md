# Mistral AI

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Victoria (Spain)]] recommended Mistral AI as an alternative to US-dominated AI models, offering more European perspectives.

## Why Mistral Matters

Victoria observed:

> "AI always ignores us, Europeans, the middle ground 😭"

> "I can talk from experience, I always have to remind the AI to consider European options in their answers"

Her recommendation:

## The European Perspective Problem

Victoria identified that mainstream AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude) have **US-centric biases**:
- Training data dominated by US sources
- Default assumptions reflect American culture
- European contexts get ignored or relegated to "other"
- Need to explicitly prompt for European perspectives

## Mistral as Alternative

[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) is a French AI company offering:
- European-developed models
- More European content in training
- Different cultural assumptions
- Alternative to US tech dominance

## Broader Issue

[[Pete Kaminski]] acknowledged:

> "It wouldn't be easy, but it could be done to collect European-centric information to train models. Europe does have a wealth of information going back centuries that would be super valuable."

Challenges:
- Much European content not digitized
- Language diversity
- Different data privacy laws (GDPR)
- Resource requirements

## Connection to Curiosity

This relates to [[Cultural Dimensions of Curiosity]]:
- If AI shapes how we ask and answer questions
- And AI has cultural biases
- Then it affects what curiosity paths seem available
- Access to diverse AI models enables more curiosity

## The Training Data Question

> "What we need is a non-US dominated internet for our training models 😂"

This raises questions about:
- Digital colonialism
- Whose knowledge gets preserved and amplified
- Cultural diversity in AI
- Right to see your own culture reflected
