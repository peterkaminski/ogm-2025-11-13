# Multi-Perspectival Humbleness

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Scott Moehring]] added this concept to the [[Excalidraw]] board in response to [[Alex Kladitis]]'s challenges about belief systems limiting curiosity.

## What It Means

Multi-perspectival humbleness combines:

**Multi-perspectival** - Actively seeking and considering multiple viewpoints:
- Not assuming your view is complete
- Looking for alternative angles
- Recognizing partial understanding
- Seeking out different perspectives

**Humbleness** - Holding views with appropriate humility:
- Acknowledging limitations
- Being willing to be wrong
- Not claiming certainty beyond evidence
- Remaining open to revision

## Connection to Alex's Challenge

[[Alex Kladitis]] provocatively stated:

> "I can go through the recordings, and I can find every single... at least one example where each one of you has made a statement, and I'm thinking, But why don't you look at it from this point of view?"

Multi-perspectival humbleness is the practice Alex was calling for:
- Before asserting, ask: "What perspective am I missing?"
- After asserting, ask: "How would this look from another angle?"
- When challenged, respond: "Tell me more about that perspective"

## Relationship to Belief Systems

From [[Belief Systems and Curiosity]]:

> "We don't want to challenge our mental model and belief system."

Multi-perspectival humbleness as antidote:
- Holds beliefs lightly enough to examine them
- Seeks perspectives that challenge comfortable views
- Treats beliefs as provisional, not identity
- Values understanding over being right

## Connection to DSRP

This relates to the "P" (Perspectives) in [[DSRP Theory]]:
- Every observation comes from a perspective
- Change perspective, change what you see
- Multiple perspectives reveal fuller picture
- No single perspective is complete

## Practice Implications

Multi-perspectival humbleness as practice might involve:
- Routinely asking "How would X see this?"
- Seeking out contrary opinions
- Acknowledging uncertainty
- Saying "I might be wrong about this" more often
- Testing your views against alternatives

## Why It Matters for Curiosity

Without multi-perspectival humbleness:
- We stop asking questions once we have "the answer"
- We dismiss perspectives that don't fit our view
- We protect beliefs rather than test them
- We mistake partial understanding for complete truth

With it:
- Questions remain open longer
- Different views become interesting rather than threatening
- Learning continues
- Curiosity survives certainty
