# Natural Logic

**Note:** This organization was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Gil Friend]]'s sustainability consultancy that focuses on helping companies identify efficiency and footprint reduction opportunities.

## Mentioned in Context

Gil shared a story from his work at Natural Logic about training a junior engineer in curiosity:

> "Early on in natural logic, we were doing lots of site assessments of companies, looking at efficiency and footprint reduction opportunities."

The engineer went on his first independent site assessment but came back without critical information because he **"didn't think to ask"** obvious follow-up questions.

This illustrated:
- Curiosity can be **trained**
- Different people have different **"maps of distinctions"** that guide inquiry
- What seems obvious to an experienced investigator isn't automatic

## Gil's Approach

The story suggests Natural Logic's methodology required:
- Systematic questioning
- Following trails of investigation
- Not accepting surface answers
- Understanding interconnected systems

This aligns with Gil's earlier introduction of [[Etymology of Curiosity]] - connecting care and attention in the context of sustainability work.
