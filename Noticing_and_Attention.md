# Noticing and Attention

The foundational relationship between noticing things and being curious about them. A crucial insight emerged: **you cannot be curious about what you don't notice first**.

## Stacey's Crucial Distinction

[[Stacey Druss]] articulated a fundamental insight near the end of the call:

> "I think we're... there's a little bit of a blurry line between the noticing and the curious, and I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious."

> "With the noticing, I do believe there are people that they just don't notice. And, like, they may not have the ability to notice, and so if you don't notice in the first place, you can't be curious."

> "Then there are people that notice and they're not curious, and there's a difference there."

### Three Categories

1. **People who don't notice** - May lack the ability to notice; curiosity is impossible without noticing first
2. **People who notice but aren't curious** - Notice but choose not to investigate further
3. **People who notice and are curious** - The ideal state

## Jerry's Response: Attention is Everything

[[Jerry Michalski]] responded:

> "So much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to, however you want to phrase that. And because only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue as you just described."

### Key Insights

- **Directing attention** is the foundation
- **Minding attention** - being aware of where attention goes
- **What we pay attention to** determines what we can be curious about
- Attention creates the **avenue** for curiosity

## The Sequence

```
Notice → Curiosity → Investigation → Learning
   ↑
   |
Attention
```

Without **attention**, there is no noticing.
Without **noticing**, there is no curiosity.
Without **curiosity**, there is no investigation.

## Questions That Emerged

[[Stacey Druss]] to [[Scott Moehring]]:

> "Thanks for noticing this relationship —> Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity? That's something I will be pondering."

This question suggests a possible **feedback loop**:
- Initial noticing enables curiosity
- Curiosity then sharpens noticing
- Enhanced noticing reveals more to be curious about

## Implications for Cultivating Curiosity

If noticing precedes curiosity, then **attention training** may be more fundamental than curiosity training:

- Practices that develop attention ([[Somatic Experiencing]], [[Presence]], meditation)
- Slowing down to notice more
- Creating [[Spaciousness]] for perception
- Reducing [[Technology and Obsolescence|technological distraction]]

## Related to Other Themes

### Education
[[LP1 (Louise)]] observed declining attention spans in students - without attention, noticing suffers, and curiosity becomes impossible.

### Somatic Practice
[[Eve Blossom]]'s work on [[Somatic Experiencing]] helps people notice **subtle signals of the body** - expanding the field of noticing.

### Etymology
From [[Etymology of Curiosity]]:

> "To be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

The etymology confirms: **care → attention → curiosity**
