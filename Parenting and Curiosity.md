# Parenting and Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

How parents cultivate (or kill) curiosity in children.

## The Reflective Approach

Multiple participants reported same practice:

[[Judith Benham]]: "Whenever I asked a question, my mom would reply 'what do you think?'"

[[Stacey Druss]]: "My dad did the same for me."

[[Gil Friend]]: "Mine too"

This [[Reflective Questioning]] approach:
- Develops metacognition
- Sustains curiosity
- Values child's thinking
- Enables expansive discussion

## The Resistance

[[Victoria (Spain)]]: "My son hated that approach at first 😂"

Children may resist because:
- Want simple answers
- Feel put on spot
- Requires more effort
- Uncomfortable at first

But long-term benefits are clear.

## What Kills Curiosity

Not explicitly discussed, but implied:
- Always providing answers
- Dismissing questions
- Being too busy
- Prioritizing compliance over inquiry
- "Because I said so"
