Meet the 16 participants who contributed to the OGM Curiosity Call on November 13, 2025. Each brought unique perspectives, experiences, and insights to the conversation.

## Facilitators

### [[Jerry Michalski]]
**Host and facilitator**

Jerry initiated the call with observations about declining curiosity in education and younger generations, setting the stage for a rich exploration. He guided the conversation while remaining open to pushback on his initial premise.

### [[Victoria (Spain)]]
**Co-organizer and visual thinker**

Victoria managed the collaborative [[Excalidraw]] board and championed the [[Question Formulation Technique]]. She diagnosed that the group was "explaining hypotheses instead of asking questions" and proposed using QFT in future sessions.

## Core Contributors

### [[Gil Friend]]
**Sustainability consultant and coach • Founder of [[Natural Logic]]**

Gil shared powerful personal stories about experiencing one-way conversations and introduced the etymology connecting curiosity to care (Latin: cura). He asked the fundamental question: "Who's we, who's they?" when discussing norms and belonging.

### [[Pete Kaminski]]
**Technology and collaboration expert**

Pete contributed the crucial insight that curiosity is a learned social practice, sharing how his wife [[Johanne]] taught him to ask questions despite being "kind of shy." He emphasized that curiosity helps everybody, not just the person being asked.

### [[Kevin Jones]]
**Impact investment pioneer**

Kevin challenged the premise of declining curiosity with "I completely disagree," offering a contrarian voice. He shared three memorable stories: Ben Santer finding his "briar patch," the Cherokee question "What does this decision make us?", and dancing eye-to-eye with a cobra in Rajasthan.

### [[Scott Moehring]]
**Game theory and systems thinker • Developer of [[Playing Games Model]]**

Scott brought frameworks including the [[Big Five Personality Traits]], [[DSRP Theory]], and his Playing Games Model. He offered the experimental definition "Curiosity = Noticing things you didn't have to notice" and brought up the [[ELIZA]] effect.

### [[LP1 (Louise)]]
**French educator with 40 years of teaching experience**

Louise provided longitudinal evidence: "Students can't pay attention for more than 30 seconds anymore." She observed calculator dependency, student anxiety about being wrong, and emphasized that "Writing = thinking!"

### [[Eve Blossom]]
**Somatic experiencing practitioner**

Eve brought the embodied perspective: "going to the creek, looking at the tadpoles" as concrete somatic curiosity practice. She emphasized curiosity requires feeling safe in the body and connected it to sense of place and living within watersheds.

### [[John Kelly]]
**Medical/hyperbaric expertise • Multi-level educator**

John shared teaching insights about working with "militantly uncurious students" in a first-generation college. He developed the what-how-why hierarchy, noting that "how is a more neutral version of why." Joined the call from inside a hyperbaric chamber.

### [[Stacey Druss]]
**Advocate for authentic inquiry**

Stacey made the foundational distinction: "If you don't notice in the first place, you can't be curious." She identified three categories of people and openly shared her fear of asking questions about illness: "I don't have the tools to know how to behave around people who are not well."

## Supporting Contributors

### [[Alex Kladitis]]
**Critical thinker on belief systems**

Alex challenged the group: "If you have a strong belief system, are you going to be curious about opposite beliefs?" This provoked deep reflection on how conviction relates to openness.

### [[Doug Breitbart]]
**Systems thinking contributor**

Doug reframed curiosity fundamentally: "The underlying ingredient is connection." He shared that his hypersocial son is "curious about people... wants to know everything about everybody" - validating social curiosity as legitimate.

### [[Judith Benham]]
**Former 3M chemist**

Judith distinguished intrinsic curiosity (genuine interest) from extrinsic curiosity (driven by external needs). She shared that her father taught through questions: "What do you think?" instead of providing answers.

### [[John Warinner]]
**Explorer of curiosity's depth**

John refined Scott's definition, noting that curiosity extends beyond noticing into exploring. He contributed to clarifying the relationship between attention, noticing, and curiosity.

### [[Karl Hebenstreit Jr]]
**Historical technology perspective**

Karl shared the slide rule story, questioning what constitutes "essential knowledge" in a changing world. His perspective added the dimension of technological change and skill obsolescence.

### [[Gabriele G]]
**Visual thinking student**

Gabriele identified "question poverty" - the anxiety of having complete freedom to ask anything but not knowing what to ask first. His vulnerability enriched the discussion of barriers to curiosity.
