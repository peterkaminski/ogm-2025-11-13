# Playing Games Model

[[Scott Moehring]]'s framework proposing that every human interaction is a game with specific characteristics.

## Scott's Theory

> "My working theory is 1) there is a set of things that all games have, 2) that every interaction with another person is a game, and 3) therefore every interaction has these things."

## The Five Elements

Scott identified five universal elements in games (and therefore all interactions):

1. **Goal** - purpose, point, reason for interacting
2. **Rules** - what's allowed or not (whether stated, implied, or customary)
3. **Voluntary** - invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated
4. **Uncertain** - can't know the outcome for sure
5. **Improve** - requires some skill

## Value

Scott noted:

> "It's been the most fascinating value I've gotten from my Playing Games model."

The framework helped him understand social interactions, including curiosity exchanges.

## Connection to Curiosity

This model illuminates [[Curiosity as Social Practice]]:

### Voluntary Nature
- Both parties must **consent** to the curiosity game
- Consent can be **withdrawn** or **renegotiated**
- [[Stacey Druss]]'s discomfort with performative curiosity reflects violated voluntary nature

### Rules
- Different cultures have different **rules** for curiosity (see [[Cultural Dimensions of Curiosity]])
- [[Gil Friend]] noted: "All games have rules. Cultures/subcultures/social classes have norms."
- Rule mismatch creates friction

### Uncertainty
- Genuine curiosity requires **not knowing** the outcome
- This connects to [[Alex Kladitis]]'s point about belief systems - we avoid uncertainty that might challenge beliefs

### Goal
- [[Jerry Michalski]] asked: "Is this really about connection?"
- The **goal** of curiosity-as-game might be connection, learning, or something else

### Skill
- [[Pete Kaminski]] learning social curiosity from Johanne shows it's a **skill**
- Some people haven't developed the skill but can learn

## Application to the Discussion

[[Pete Kaminski]]:

> "It's a bit of a participatory game that is best played by both participants; it's okay to answer by redirecting to a different topic rather than one you don't want to talk about."

This perfectly captures the Playing Games Model applied to curiosity.
