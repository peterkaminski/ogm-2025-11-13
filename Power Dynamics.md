# Power Dynamics

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Several participants noted that power shapes how curiosity is experienced and expressed.

## Stacey's Core Insight

[[Stacey Druss]]:

> "As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."

Curiosity from those with more power can feel like:
- **Interrogation** rather than interest
- **Demand** for justification
- **Prying** into private matters
- **Work** you're being asked to do

## Gender and Power

[[Pete Kaminski]] shared from Johanne:

> "Men are acculturated to not be curious, especially about women."

> "In a way, it was a kind of women's work, that she doesn't mind doing because it's not the worst thing that women have to do in this world."

Power dynamics:
- Emotional labor falls to those with less power
- Asking questions (curiosity) becomes **women's work**
- Men with more social power aren't taught to be curious
- This reinforces power imbalances

## Who Asks Whom Matters

The same question means different things based on power:

**From those with power:**
- Boss asking employee → Can feel like evaluation
- Teacher asking student → Can feel like test
- Man asking woman → Can feel like demand
- Older asking younger → Can feel like judgment

**Between equals:**
- Peer asking peer → Can feel like genuine interest
- Friend asking friend → Can feel like care
- Colleague asking colleague → Can feel like collaboration

**From those seeking power:**
- Can feel patronizing
- Can feel manipulative
- Can feel like data extraction

## Cultural Power

From [[Cultural Dimensions of Curiosity]]:

Different cultures have different power distances:
- Some expect questions up the hierarchy
- Some see questions as disrespectful
- Power shapes what curiosity is appropriate

## Institutional Power

[[Gil Friend]]'s story about training his junior engineer:
- The senior person had to **teach** curiosity
- Power difference made feedback possible
- But also might have made junior person hesitant to ask

## The Disempowerment Problem

Stacey's point reveals:
- Those who feel disempowered may experience questions as burden
- They may lack power to refuse to answer
- They may feel required to educate
- Curiosity can reinforce rather than bridge power gaps

## Making Curiosity Safe

If power shapes curiosity, what helps?

From [[Playing Games Model]]:
- **Voluntary** - both parties must consent
- **Rules** - clear norms about what's appropriate
- Ability to **decline** or **redirect**

From [[Genuine vs Performative Curiosity]]:
- **Humility** in asking
- **Authentic** interest, not performance
- **Care** for the person, not just information

## Unanswered Questions

- How do we teach curiosity across power differences?
- Can those with power learn to ask without burdening?
- How do we empower those without power to be curious?
- What makes curiosity liberating rather than oppressive?
