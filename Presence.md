# Presence

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Being fully present to what is, a foundation for curiosity.

## Eve's Perspective

[[Eve Blossom]]:

> "Curiosity becomes less an effort of the mind and more a natural opening to what is present, possible, and previously unseen."

Curiosity about:
- **What is present** - here now
- **What is possible** - potential futures
- **What is previously unseen** - newly available

All require being **present** rather than:
- Lost in past
- Anxious about future
- Distracted
- Disconnected

## Connection to Place

[[Sense of Place]] requires presence to where you are physically.
