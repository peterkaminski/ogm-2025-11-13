# Question Formulation Technique

A structured methodology from the [[Right Question Institute]] for teaching people how to formulate good questions.

## Victoria's Advocacy

[[Victoria (Spain)]] was passionate about this tool:

> "Do any of you know about the Question Formulation Technique of the Right Question Institute?"

> "I discovered that some years ago and I ALWAYS recommend it. Is such a useful tool!"

## Why It Matters

The QFT addresses a meta-problem identified by [[Gabriele G]]:

> "I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because 'I don't know what to ask (first)', I have some trails but they were so vague."

> "Why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?"

### The Paradox of Freedom

Gabriele's experience reveals that **unlimited freedom can paralyze** rather than liberate inquiry. The QFT provides structure that enables genuine freedom through helpful constraints.

## Reception

[[Gabriele G]]:

> "This is so interesting! Thank you for this share! I appreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question 'good' to ask."

[[Doug Breitbart]]: "Thanks for this, Victoria. 🙏🏻"

[[Gil Friend]]: 🙏🏼

## The Four Rules for Producing Questions

[[Jerry Michalski]] read the four rules into the conversation at Victoria's suggestion:

1. **Ask as many questions as you can**
2. **Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss**
3. **Write down every question exactly as stated**
4. **Change any statements into questions**

This simple protocol creates a safe space for question generation without the usual constraints of having to answer, defend, or justify.

## The Full QFT Process

Victoria emphasized that QFT is **not just about making a list of questions**:

> "The question formulation technique does not end in the list of questions. It ends when you decide to prioritize the questions, And what to do with the first three questions that are in your list."

### Complete Process

1. **Generate questions** - Using the four rules above
2. **Prioritize questions** - Decide which matter most
3. **Decide what to do** - Take action on the top three questions

## Victoria's Proposal for the Curiosity Call

Near the end of the call, Victoria suggested using QFT for future OGM conversations:

> "I think we need to do something like that with a good focus question. And start asking the questions first. And then, like, playing with... these questions, prioritize, and then decide what to do."

### Her Diagnosis

> "Because I love the conversation, I've learned a lot. But I don't think we have really... start to uncover half of... what Curiosity is about. Because we were explaining our hypothesis instead of asking questions."

Victoria saw that the group had been **sharing hypotheses and ideas** rather than **asking questions first**. The QFT could flip this dynamic.

## Real-World Example: Greek Mythology Seminar

Victoria shared a concrete example of QFT in action:

> "I was attending a seminar more or less, very informal, just like this. among people who were interested in learning about Greek mythology."

### The Problem

> "The idea was that... We raised the theme, and one person was preparing the theme for the next session. And people would come with questions. Nobody did, nobody asked, of course."

Despite the intention for people to bring questions, **nobody actually asked questions**.

### The Transformation

> "Until I suggested this... And then... we had so many questions, and we were able, like, to really go in the direction we wanted, Because we ended with those lists of questions, prioritize them, decide what to do with them."

Using QFT:
- Generated **many questions**
- Allowed the group to **go in the direction they wanted**
- Created **personalized learning paths**

### The Outcome

> "Uh, some people were, like, For example, I want to invest to go further, uh, research, the... the hero hearing... uh... difference... I want to go through this other path, so... Each one decided The next session, instead of having this, like, standardized sessions. Because they were the topics everybody talks about? And it was really enriched in. enricher for everybody."

Instead of **standardized sessions** on "the topics everybody talks about," participants:
- Pursued **individual questions**
- Followed **different paths**
- Made sessions **richer for everybody**

## Jerry and Victoria's Agreement

Jerry responded positively:

> "Um, I like it. Uh, and I'm... Tempted to... go back to the topic of curiosity, or just shift around? I don't know... open to whatever anybody wants to suggest, but I think using this would be great."

Jerry's immediate question:

> "I think my... the immediate question that comes to mind is, At the end of this process, you have a... apparently a really long, great list of questions, then what do you do?"

Victoria clarified that **prioritization and action** are built into the QFT, not afterthoughts.

They agreed to:

> "So I... let's you and I talk about that some more, so we can sort of set this up. Anybody else who's interested, let us know on the OGM list."

## Teaching Question Formation

The QFT is designed to teach people:
- How to generate questions
- How to improve questions
- How to prioritize questions
- How to use questions effectively

This addresses a critical gap in education where students are rarely taught **the skill of asking** - only answering.
