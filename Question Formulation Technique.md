# Question Formulation Technique

A structured methodology from the [[Right Question Institute]] for teaching people how to formulate good questions.

## Victoria's Advocacy

[[Victoria (Spain)]] was passionate about this tool:

> "Do any of you know about the Question Formulation Technique of the Right Question Institute?"

> "I discovered that some years ago and I ALWAYS recommend it. Is such a useful tool!"

## Why It Matters

The QFT addresses a meta-problem identified by [[Gabriele G]]:

> "I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because 'I don't know what to ask (first)', I have some trails but they were so vague."

> "Why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?"

### The Paradox of Freedom

Gabriele's experience reveals that **unlimited freedom can paralyze** rather than liberate inquiry. The QFT provides structure that enables genuine freedom through helpful constraints.

## Reception

[[Gabriele G]]:

> "This is so interesting! Thank you for this share! I appreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question 'good' to ask."

[[Doug Breitbart]]: "Thanks for this, Victoria. 🙏🏻"

[[Gil Friend]]: 🙏🏼

## Teaching Question Formation

The QFT is designed to teach people:
- How to generate questions
- How to improve questions
- How to prioritize questions
- How to use questions effectively

This addresses a critical gap in education where students are rarely taught **the skill of asking** - only answering.
