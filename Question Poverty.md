# Question Poverty

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Gabriele G]]'s term for the experience of not knowing what questions to ask.

## Gabriele's Experience

> "I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because 'I don't know what to ask (first)', I have some trails but they were so vague."

> "Why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?"

## The Paradox

Complete freedom can create poverty:
- Too many possibilities
- No structure to guide
- Anxiety about asking "wrong" thing
- Vague thoughts not yet questions

## The Solution

[[Question Formulation Technique]] helps by:
- Providing structure
- Teaching how to generate questions
- Offering a process
- Making it safe to practice

## Broader Implications

If question poverty is common:
- [[Education and Curiosity]] fails to teach questioning
- We teach answering but not asking
- Structure enables rather than constrains
- Freedom needs scaffolding
