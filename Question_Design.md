# Question Design

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The art and practice of crafting good questions.

## Why It Matters

[[Gabriele G]]'s experience:

> "I don't know what to ask (first), I have some trails but they were so vague."

> "Why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?"

Question design helps with:
- Knowing what to ask
- How to phrase it
- When to ask
- How to sequence questions

## Tools

- [[Question Formulation Technique]] - structured approach
- [[How vs Why Questions]] - choosing safer phrasing
- [[5 Whys]] - structured depth
- [[Socratic Method]] - questions that guide thinking

## Gabriele's Discovery

Finding [[Question Formulation Technique]] helped:

> "I appreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question 'good' to ask."
