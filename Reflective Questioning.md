# Reflective Questioning

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The practice of reflecting questions back to encourage deeper thinking.

## The Practice

From [[Judith Benham]]'s mother:

> "Whenever I asked a question, my mom would reply 'what do you think?'"

Instead of answering directly:
- Reflect question back
- Prompt self-exploration
- Value learner's reasoning
- Enable expansive discussion

## Why It Works

Reflective questioning:
- Develops [[Metacognition]]
- Builds confidence
- Sustains curiosity
- Teaches thinking process
- Makes curiosity active not passive

## Related to Socratic Method

Part of [[Socratic Method]] tradition of teaching through questions.

## In the Call

Multiple participants ([[Gil Friend]], [[Stacey Druss]]) reported same parenting approach:
"What do you think?" → expansive discussion
