# Safety and Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

From [[Eve Blossom]]'s [[Somatic Experiencing]] perspective: curiosity requires feeling safe to explore.

## Eve's Insight

> "Somatic experiencing can deepen curiosity by helping the body feel safe to explore rather than be passive, be reactive."

When the body feels unsafe:
- Fight/flight/freeze activates
- Curiosity shuts down
- Survival takes precedence
- Exploration becomes impossible

When safe:
- Body can relax
- Curiosity emerges naturally
- Exploration becomes possible
- New perceptions accessible
