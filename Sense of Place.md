# Sense of Place

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Eve Blossom]] introduced "sense of place" as connected to curiosity.

## Eve's Contribution

[[Jerry Michalski]] captured:

> "Eve: curiosity + sense of place, to keep it alive"

[[Victoria (Spain)]] added it to the [[Excalidraw]] board:

> "@Eve Blossom I added your sense of place to the whiteboard. You can elaborate there if you want"

## What Sense of Place Means

While Eve didn't elaborate fully during the call, sense of place typically involves:
- **Physical connection** to a specific location
- **Embodied relationship** with environment
- **Attentiveness** to where you are
- **Care** for a particular place
- **Rootedness** rather than abstraction

## Connection to Curiosity

The relationship suggested:
- Curiosity about **where you are** keeps you alive (engaged, present)
- **Place-based curiosity** grounds abstract inquiry
- You must **care about place** to be curious about it
- Sense of place might **sustain curiosity** over time

## Relationship to Etymology

This connects powerfully to [[Etymology of Curiosity]] - curiosity as care:

If **to be curious is to care enough to pay attention**, then:
- Sense of place = caring attention to location
- Without place-grounding, curiosity becomes abstract
- Losing sense of place might weaken curiosity

## Somatic Connection

Sense of place is inherently embodied, linking to [[Somatic Experiencing]]:
- Your **body** is always somewhere
- [[Somatic Experiencing]] tunes into bodily experience
- Sense of place connects body to environment
- Together they create **embodied curiosity**

## Implications

If sense of place sustains curiosity:
- Does **placelessness** of modern life dampen curiosity?
- Can **virtual spaces** create sense of place?
- Does **travel** enhance or diminish place-based curiosity?
- Is **local knowledge** a form of curiosity?

## Environmental Context

Given [[Gil Friend]]'s sustainability work and Eve's emphasis, sense of place might relate to:
- Environmental awareness
- Ecological literacy
- Bioregionalism
- Care for specific ecosystems
