# Slide Rules

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Mechanical calculation devices that were once essential for engineers and scientists.

## The Story

[[Karl Hebenstreit Jr]]:

> "My dad's physics professor in college: 'Buy a quality slide rule because you'll be using it the remainder of your career'"

Of course, electronic calculators made slide rules obsolete within years.

## Gil's Memory

[[Gil Friend]]:

> "I think mine is around here somewhere…"

Many in the group remembered the slide rule era.

## Victoria's Father

[[Victoria (Spain)]] mentioned her father wrote a Wikipedia article on calculation rules (presumably including slide rules), spending over a year on it - an act of deep curiosity about obsolete technology.

## The Lesson

Same pattern repeats:
- Today's essential tool
- Tomorrow's museum piece
- Experts can't predict which tools will endure
- See [[Technology and Obsolescence]]
