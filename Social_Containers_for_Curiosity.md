# Social Containers for Curiosity

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Creating contexts where curiosity can safely emerge, from [[John Kelly]]'s insight.

## John's Approach

[[Pete Kaminski]] paraphrased:

> "I found that if you created a context in which there's a social reason for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the benefit."

## How It Works

Rather than:
- Demanding curiosity
- Telling people to be curious
- Explaining benefits upfront

Create containers where:
- Social participation is the draw
- Curiosity emerges naturally
- Discovery happens indirectly
- Value is experienced, not explained

## The Game Element

Related to [[Playing Games Model]]:
- Games create containers
- Rules make it safe
- Social motivation enables participation
- Learning happens through play

## Examples

Possible containers:
- Structured discussions
- Collaborative projects
- Group inquiry sessions
- Whiteboard explorations (like [[Excalidraw]])

## The Insight

> "If you'd told them to look for it, they probably wouldn't have. But because it happened inside this little game, they ended up uncovering something new."

Indirect discovery beats direct instruction.
