# Socratic Method

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

Teaching through questions rather than direct instruction, exemplified by [[Judith Benham]]'s mother's approach.

## Judith's Example

> "As a child, whenever I asked a question, my mom would reply 'what do you think?', which led to expansive discussion."

This is classic Socratic method:
- Answer questions with questions
- Guide discovery rather than tell
- Build critical thinking
- Value the learner's thinking

## Benefits for Curiosity

- Keeps questions open longer
- Develops metacognition
- Builds confidence in own reasoning
- Makes thinking visible
- Sustains curiosity rather than closing with answers

## The Challenge

[[Victoria (Spain)]]: "My son hated that approach at first 😂"

Can be frustrating when you want a simple answer!

But long-term: develops [[Reflective Questioning]] and sustained curiosity.
