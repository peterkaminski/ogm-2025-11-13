# Stacey Druss

**Role:** Advocate for authentic inquiry and genuine curiosity

## Contributions to the Discussion

Stacey brought an important critical perspective on the difference between genuine and performative curiosity.

### The Problem with Performative Curiosity

Stacey's key intervention:

> "Curiosity when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying."

> "As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."

[[Jerry Michalski]] captured it: "It feels like prying, you mean?"

> "Yeah, or, or, like, having to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing. When it's genuine, it's wonderful."

### Personal Boundaries

Stacey was refreshingly honest about her own practices:

> "You know me, I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do. I'm sorry, anybody. I don't probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you. Forgive me! Forgive me."

[[Pete Kaminski]] responded: "Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy."

### George Monbiot and Storytelling

Stacey referenced [[George Monbiot]]:

> "Where we don't have a story, we make up one."

She connected this to [[Gil Friend]]'s stories about people who don't ask questions, noting:

> "The story that I made up in my mind, is that sometimes people that are either younger or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age..."

This introduced the idea that **lack of experience** (not just youth) might explain apparent incuriosity.

### Fear of Asking Questions About Illness

From the transcript, Stacey shared a vulnerable personal insight:

> "I'm afraid to ask questions. I don't... I personally don't have the tools to know how to behave around people who are not well."

> "So if... my approach might be I... I don't know what to ask. It doesn't mean I don't care, or I'm not curious, or I don't want to help. It's... I don't... I'm uncomfortable."

This reveals an important dimension: **Sometimes apparent incuriosity is actually discomfort or fear**.

Stacey's honesty shows:
- Not asking ≠ not caring
- Silence can come from not knowing how to ask appropriately
- Cultural/social anxiety around illness prevents inquiry
- We need better "tools" for asking sensitive questions

### The Crucial Distinction: Noticing vs Curiosity

Near the end of the call, Stacey made one of the most important conceptual contributions:

> "I think we're... there's a little bit of a blurry line between the noticing and the curious, and I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious."

> "With the noticing, I do believe there are people that they just don't notice. And, like, they may not have the ability to notice, and so if you don't notice in the first place, you can't be curious."

> "Then there are people that notice and they're not curious, and there's a difference there."

#### Stacey's Three Categories

1. **People who don't notice** - May lack ability; curiosity impossible without noticing
2. **People who notice but aren't curious** - Notice but don't investigate
3. **People who notice and are curious** - Full engagement

This distinction fundamentally reframes curiosity cultivation: **First teach noticing, then curiosity**.

### Noticing the Relationship

Stacey made an important observation to [[Scott Moehring]]:

> "Thanks for noticing this relationship —> Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity? That's something I will be pondering."

### AI and Patience

> "And they don't lose patience when you keep rephrasing the question with good reason, I might add ;)"

Stacey appreciated that AI allows iterative questioning without human frustration.

### Parenting Experience

Like [[Judith Benham]] and [[Gil Friend]], Stacey's father used the reflective questioning approach:

> "My dad did the same for me" (asking "what do you think?" instead of providing answers)
