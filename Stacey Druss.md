# Stacey Druss

**Role:** Advocate for authentic inquiry and genuine curiosity

## Contributions to the Discussion

Stacey brought an important critical perspective on the difference between genuine and performative curiosity.

### The Problem with Performative Curiosity

Stacey's key intervention:

> "Curiosity when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying."

> "As someone who sometimes feels, or has felt disempowered, sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."

[[Jerry Michalski]] captured it: "It feels like prying, you mean?"

> "Yeah, or, or, like, having to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing. When it's genuine, it's wonderful."

### Personal Boundaries

Stacey was refreshingly honest about her own practices:

> "You know me, I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do. I'm sorry, anybody. I don't probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you. Forgive me! Forgive me."

[[Pete Kaminski]] responded: "Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy."

### George Monbiot and Storytelling

Stacey referenced [[George Monbiot]]:

> "Where we don't have a story, we make up one."

She connected this to [[Gil Friend]]'s stories about people who don't ask questions, noting:

> "The story that I made up in my mind, is that sometimes people that are either younger or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age..."

This introduced the idea that **lack of experience** (not just youth) might explain apparent incuriosity.

### Noticing the Relationship

Stacey made an important observation to [[Scott Moehring]]:

> "Thanks for noticing this relationship —> Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity? That's something I will be pondering."

### AI and Patience

> "And they don't lose patience when you keep rephrasing the question with good reason, I might add ;)"

Stacey appreciated that AI allows iterative questioning without human frustration.

### Parenting Experience

Like [[Judith Benham]] and [[Gil Friend]], Stacey's father used the reflective questioning approach:

> "My dad did the same for me" (asking "what do you think?" instead of providing answers)
