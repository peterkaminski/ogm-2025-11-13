# Technology Adoption

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

How people adopt new technologies relates to curiosity and openness.

## Pete's Experience

[[Pete Kaminski]] described his approach to new technology:

> "I don't know what it does, but let me find out, let me try to break it, let me try to do crazy stuff with it, can it do this, can it do that?"

Early adoption of:
- Personal computers
- Internet
- AI

All required **curiosity-driven exploration**.

## The Hard Work

Pete noted with AI:

> "When I tried playing with it, it was actually hard work, I remember. Having to sit down and go, okay, what can I do with it now? What crazy thing could I give it?"

Adoption isn't passive:
- Requires active curiosity
- Demands experimentation
- Takes persistence
- Needs willingness to fail

## Who Adopts?

> "I see a lot of people bouncing off new technology because of that."

Adoption correlates with:
- [[Openness]] (personality trait)
- Curiosity
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Willingness to look foolish
- Time and energy to explore

## Implications

If technology requires curiosity to adopt:
- Teaching curiosity matters more as tech accelerates
- Those without curiosity get left behind
- Digital divides may be curiosity divides
- [[Education and Curiosity]] becomes more urgent
