# Technology and Obsolescence

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The rapid pace of technological change means today's essential knowledge becomes tomorrow's obsolete skill.

## The Slide Rule Story

[[Karl Hebenstreit Jr]] shared:

> "My dad's physics professor in college: 'Buy a quality slide rule because you'll be using it the remainder of your career'"

This perfectly captures how:
- Experts can't predict which tools will endure
- Essential knowledge changes faster than expected
- What seems permanent becomes obsolete
- Students face uncertainty about what to learn

## Parallels to Today

Same questions now about:
- Calculators → mental math
- Spell-check → spelling skills
- GPS → navigation skills
- AI → writing, coding, analysis skills

Each raises: What's still essential?

## Connection to Curiosity

If tools keep changing:
- Curiosity about **how tools work** might matter more than **using specific tools**
- **Adaptability** matters more than **specific skills**
- Need to be curious about **what's coming next**
- [[AI and Curiosity]] - same old questions, new tools
