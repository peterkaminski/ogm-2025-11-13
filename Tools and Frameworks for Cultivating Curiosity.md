# Tools and Frameworks for Cultivating Curiosity

The conversation surfaced several practical tools and frameworks for developing and sustaining curiosity.

## Question Formulation Technique (QFT)

[[Victoria (Spain)]] enthusiastically shared:

> "Do any of you know about the Question Formulation Technique of the Right Question Institute?"

> "I discovered that some years ago and I ALWAYS recommend it. Is such a useful tool!"

[Question Formulation Technique](https://rightquestion.org/what-is-the-qft/)

### Why QFT Matters

[[Gabriele G]] described experiencing **"anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom"** in a Q&A session. The QFT provides structure that paradoxically **enables freedom** through constraints.

> "I appreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question 'good' to ask."

[[Doug Breitbart]]: "Thanks for this, Victoria. 🙏🏻"

The QFT addresses the meta-problem: **How do you learn to formulate good questions?**

## The 5 Whys

[[Jerry Michalski]] shared:

> [5 Whys Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)

This technique from lean manufacturing and systems thinking involves:
- Asking "why" five times in succession
- Getting past surface symptoms to root causes
- Building on each answer to go deeper

### Social Container for 5 Whys

[[John Kelly]] (via [[Pete Kaminski]]):

> "I found that if you created a context in which there's a social reason for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the benefit in terms of the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of realizing, 'Oh—we actually discovered something we weren't even looking for.'"

Key insight: **Social motivation** can bootstrap genuine curiosity.

## DSRP Theory

[[Scott Moehring]] described it as **"the most important and practical thing I've ever learned"**:

> "I think it is the organization and reorganization of information that is the primary space of curiosity."

[DSRP Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSRP)

DSRP stands for:
- **D**istinctions - what is and isn't
- **S**ystems - parts and wholes
- **R**elationships - connections between things
- **P**erspectives - different viewpoints

[[Doug Breitbart]] provided the Wikipedia link when [[Kevin Jones]] asked about it.

## The Playing Games Model

[[Scott Moehring]]'s framework proposing that **every interaction is a game** with five elements:

1. **Goal** - purpose, point, reason for interacting
2. **Rules** - what's allowed or not (stated, implied, or customary)
3. **Voluntary** - invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated
4. **Uncertain** - can't know the outcome for sure
5. **Improve** - requires some skill

This helps understand curiosity as a **participatory practice** both parties must engage in.

## Big Five Personality Traits

[[Scott Moehring]] introduced this as the "statistically verified model of personality" to understand **Openness** as a dimension of curiosity:

[Big Five Personality Traits Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

The five traits:
- Openness (includes curiosity, creativity, intellectual interest)
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

Key insight: **Neither high nor low openness is evolutionarily better** - both have value in different contexts.

## Reflective Questioning (Socratic Method)

[[Judith Benham]]'s mother's approach:

> "As a child, whenever I asked a question, my mom would reply 'what do you think?', which led to expansive discussion."

This builds:
- **Metacognition**
- **Confidence** in own thinking
- **Patience** with ambiguity
- **Expansive discussion** rather than closed answers

[[Stacey Druss]] and [[Gil Friend]] reported similar parenting experiences.

## "How" vs "Why"

[[John Kelly]] observed:

> "How is a more neutral version of why"

Practical technique: Asking **"how"** questions may be:
- Less threatening
- Less loaded with judgment
- More likely to elicit open responses
- More exploratory and less demanding

## Multi-Perspectival Humbleness

[[Scott Moehring]] added this concept to the [[Excalidraw]] board in response to [[Alex Kladitis]]'s points about belief systems.

The practice of:
- Acknowledging **your perspective is limited**
- **Actively seeking** other viewpoints
- Holding beliefs with **humility**
- Being willing to **revise** when shown other angles

## Visual Thinking / Excalidraw

[[Victoria (Spain)]] and [[Gabriele G]] both engaged with visual thinking as a tool for curiosity:

The collaborative [[Excalidraw]] whiteboard allowed:
- **Real-time visual collaboration**
- **Non-linear thinking**
- **Connection-making** across concepts
- **Collective sense-making**

Link to the board: [Excalidraw session](https://excalidraw.com/#room=f2fc1ed4dad8ce25b385,JsA211Hzb_1dUSb-gwYctQ)

## Writing as Thinking

[[LP1 (Louise)]]: "Writing = thinking!"

[[Victoria (Spain)]]:

> "Writing and drawing were the first externalizations of the brain humans practiced, and what enabled our intellectual evolution"

Practical implication: **Writing clarifies and deepens curiosity** in ways thinking alone doesn't.

Example: Victoria's father spent **over a year** writing a Wikipedia article on calculation rules - the writing process itself was an act of deep curiosity.

## Etymology Study

[[Gil Friend]]'s practice of exploring **word origins** as a curiosity tool:

> "I'm an etymology geek"

Understanding the [[Etymology of Curiosity]] (from Latin "cura" = care) reframes what curiosity is and why it matters.

## The Culture Shock Series

[[Jerry Michalski]]: "The Culture Shock series were good"

Books that helped people develop **cross-cultural curiosity** through structured frameworks.

## AI as Curiosity Partner

Multiple participants noted AI can:
- Provide **patient iteration** ([[Stacey Druss]])
- Allow **safe questioning** without judgment ([[Victoria (Spain)]])
- Enable **medical curiosity** ([[Gil Friend]])
- Require **active curiosity to use well** ([[Pete Kaminski]])

See [[AI and Curiosity]] for full discussion.

## What Makes a Good Curiosity Tool?

Based on the conversation, effective tools:

1. **Provide structure** without rigidity (like QFT)
2. **Lower barriers** to asking (like neutral "how" questions)
3. **Create social safety** (like John Kelly's game containers)
4. **Build on natural impulses** (like the 5 Whys)
5. **Make thinking visible** (like Excalidraw, writing)
6. **Work across cultures** (though may need adaptation)
7. **Can be taught** relatively easily
8. **Lead to unexpected discoveries**

## Gaps and Opportunities

Tools we might need but didn't discuss:
- How to teach **genuine vs performative curiosity**
- Frameworks for **cross-cultural curiosity**
- Tools for **recovering curiosity** killed by education
- Practices for **noticing what you notice**
- Ways to measure or track curiosity development
