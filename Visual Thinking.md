# Visual Thinking

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

[[Victoria (Spain)]] and [[Gabriele G]] are both engaged with visual thinking as a practice for organizing and expressing ideas.

## Victoria's Practice

Victoria managed the collaborative [[Excalidraw]] board throughout the call, demonstrating visual thinking in action:

> "Let's open as many questions as possible. So if instead of saying, 'education closes curiosity,' we state it as a question: 'Does education close?' Then we will have more things to work with."

Key principles:
- **Visual organization** of concepts
- **Keeping questions open** rather than closing with answers
- **Collaborative sense-making**
- **Non-linear exploration**

## Connection to Brain Evolution

Victoria connected visual thinking to human evolution:

> "Writing and drawing were the first externalizations of the brain humans practiced, and what enabled our intellectual evolution"

This suggests:
- Visual thinking is **fundamental** to human cognition
- **Externalizing thought** (through drawing/writing) enables new levels of thinking
- Visual representation isn't just communication but **thinking tool**

## Gabriele's Experience

Gabriele met Victoria through "an online workshop on Visual thinking" and brought that lens to the curiosity discussion.

Gabriele's struggle with "anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom" might be helped by visual thinking:
- Drawing out vague ideas
- Mapping question territories visually
- Seeing connections between half-formed thoughts

## Visual Tools for Curiosity

The [[Excalidraw]] board enabled:
- **Spatial organization** - related ideas near each other
- **Simultaneous viewing** - see whole landscape at once
- **Multiple contributors** - collective intelligence
- **Iterative development** - build on others' additions
- **Preserving openness** - questions remain visible

## Benefits for Curiosity

Visual thinking might support curiosity by:
- Making **connections visible**
- Allowing **non-sequential** exploration
- Creating **shared mental models**
- Reducing **cognitive load** (externalized memory)
- Enabling **pattern recognition**
- Supporting **divergent thinking**

## Relationship to Other Tools

Visual thinking complements:
- [[Writing and Thinking]] - both externalize thought
- [[DSRP Theory]] - visualizing distinctions, systems, relationships, perspectives
- [[Question Formulation Technique]] - mapping question territories
- [[Playing Games Model]] - diagramming interaction patterns

## The Workshop Context

That Victoria and Gabriele connected through a visual thinking workshop suggests:
- Growing community of practice
- Methods being taught and shared
- Connection to [[Education and Curiosity]]
- Tools for [[Metacognition]]
