# What Is Curiosity?

One of the central threads of the call was defining curiosity itself - what it is, what it isn't, and how we recognize it.

## Definitions Proposed

### Noticing and Exploring

[[Scott Moehring]] proposed:

> "Curiosity = Noticing things you didn't have to notice."

[[John Warinner]] refined this:

> "To me, curiosity extends beyond 'noticing' and gets into 'exploring'"

[[Pete Kaminski]] suggested:

> "Curiosity = Noticing things you didn't know that you needed to know."

This sparked deeper inquiry about the relationship between **noticing** and **curiosity** - which comes first?

### Connection to Care

[[Gil Friend]] introduced the [[Etymology of Curiosity]], revealing its roots in the Latin word "cura" (care):

> "To be curious is to care enough to pay attention."

[[John Warinner]] reinforced: "The etymology connects back to 'care' and 'attention to detail'"

This reframes curiosity not as detached intellectual pursuit but as an **act of caring**.

### Organization of Information

[[Scott Moehring]] cited [[DSRP Theory]]:

> "I think it is the organization and reorganization of information that is the primary space of curiosity."

This suggests curiosity is fundamentally about **making new connections** and patterns.

## What Curiosity Is NOT

### Not Just About Information

[[Victoria (Spain)]] emphasized:

> "Curiosity is not just about information... we want to understand the big questions, and find meaning"

This connects curiosity to **existential questions** and the search for meaning.

### The Genuine vs Performative Distinction

[[Stacey Druss]] highlighted an important boundary:

> "Curiosity when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying... sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself."

**Genuine curiosity** feels like connection; **performative curiosity** can feel like prying or demands for justification.

## Complexity of Curiosity

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic

[[Judith Benham]] introduced a framework:

> "Curiosity, per se, is complex. Intrinsic vs extrinsic…situation, knowledge, experiences."

Curiosity can arise from:
- **Internal drives** and interests (intrinsic)
- **External stimuli** and situations (extrinsic)

### Individual and Cultural

[[LP1 (Louise)]] captured the dual nature:

> "Curiosity is individual and cultural."

We cannot understand curiosity purely as personal trait OR cultural phenomenon - it's both.

## Components of Curiosity

Based on the discussion, curiosity seems to involve:

1. **Noticing** - attending to what's present
2. **Caring** - valuing what you notice enough to pursue it
3. **Exploring** - actively investigating rather than passively observing
4. **Connecting** - organizing and reorganizing information into new patterns
5. **Questioning** - asking rather than assuming
6. **Openness** - willingness to have your mind changed

## The Chicken-and-Egg Question

[[Scott Moehring]] posed a question that remained unresolved:

> "Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity?"

[[Kevin Jones]]: "For me, noticing first."

This suggests curiosity might be both cause and effect of attention.
