# Writing and Thinking

**Note:** This topic was mentioned during the call but not discussed in depth.

The deep connection between writing and thinking, emphasized by [[LP1 (Louise)]].

## Louise's Point

> "Writing = thinking!"

Not just:
- Writing **about** thinking
- Writing **to record** thinking

But:
- Writing **IS** thinking
- Writing **creates** thinking
- Writing **clarifies** thinking

## Victoria's Historical Perspective

[[Victoria (Spain)]]:

> "Writing and drawing were the first externalizations of the brain humans practiced, and what enabled our intellectual evolution"

Externalizing thought:
- Enabled new levels of cognition
- Made thinking visible
- Allowed iterative refinement
- Created knowledge outside individual minds

## Victoria's Father's Example

Spent **over a year** writing Wikipedia article on calculation rules.

The writing itself was the inquiry:
- Not just recording knowledge
- But developing understanding
- Deep curiosity expressed through writing
- Meticulous craft

## For Curiosity

If writing = thinking:
- Writing develops curiosity
- Journaling sustains questions
- Note-taking deepens inquiry
- [[Question Formulation Technique]] works through writing

## AI Implications

From [[AI and Curiosity]]:

If AI does our writing:
- Are we losing thinking tool?
- Or gaining thinking partner?
- See [[Tools as Crutches]]
